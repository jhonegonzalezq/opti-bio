	abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) can be used to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and help transition towards a circular economy. The MSW supply chain is complex and needs to be optimized to minimize total supply chain costs. There are few studies on the integrated optimization of the MSW supply chain with a waste-to-energy (WtE) conversion facility. This study developed a framework to optimize various cost parameters, including feedstock collection, transportation, capital, maintenance, and operations costs simultaneously through an integrated GIS-based mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model considering the WtE conversion facility scale. A GIS location-allocation analysis using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach was used to identify candidate sites for WtE facilities based on environmental, economic, and social criteria. GIS origin-destination cost functions were used to determine the precise distances from transfer stations by road and rail to candidate facilities and, subsequently, landfills. These outputs were then used for the MINLP framework to optimize the number, location, and size of WtE facilities. A case study for Western Canada was conducted considering 447 landfills in 4 provinces. More than 5800 candidate locations and 598 transfer stations were screened. The results show that at a discount rate of 10%, the electricity production cost is competitive at only 10.99 $/MWh when the gate fee (charged by a WtE facility for processing waste) of 35 $/tonne and a carbon credit of 15 $/tonne are considered as a source of revenue, accounting for all cost factors. The optimal site is in Foothills County, Alberta, and it has a size of 183 MW. The sensitivity analysis shows the most sensitive parameters on the per-unit electricity production cost are plant efficiency, capital cost, and gate fees. The associated uncertainties in the cost of electricity production are 10.99 ± 6.88 $/MWh. The results of the study can help in making investment decisions and policy formulation. © 2025 The Author(s)},

Better understanding of the interactions between landscape-related decisions and the design of biorefineries with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a supply chain context is needed to enable efficient systems. Here we analyse the cost and greenhouse gas mitigation potential for cellulosic biofuel supply chains in the US Midwest using realistic spatially explicit land availability and crop productivity data and consider fuel conversion technologies with detailed CCS design for their associated CO2 streams. Optimization methods identify trade-offs and design strategies leading to systems with attractive environmental and economic performance. Strategic and operational decisions depend on underlying spatial features and are sensitive to biofuel demand and CCS incentives. US CCS incentives neglect to motivate greenhouse gas mitigation from all supply chain emission sources, which leverage spatial interactions between CCS, electricity prices and the biomass landscape. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {To address climate change and ensure energy security, biomass energy has become a popular renewable energy alternative to traditional fossil fuels. This study focuses on the strategic planning and tactical management problem of a regional biomass supply chain system with multiple feedstock and final products. A novel SVC-based data-driven robust optimization model is developed to provide the tradeoff solutions under uncertainties. Compared with the traditional robust optimization model, it can better depict the uncertain sets, reduce data redundancy, and provide less conservative strategies for decision makers according to their risk preferences. The proposed model is validated through a case study, Meizhou city in China. The results suggested the optimal investment scale and site for biorefineries and biomass power plants at the strategic planning level, as well as the feedstock supply network, inventory management, and production arrangement at the tactic management level. The optimal robust solutions can be derived by varying the envelope level of the uncertain sets. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influences of the variations of key parameters. It is found that the produced bioethanol and electricity lack cost advantages in the current situation, even with a 30 % reduction in main cost parameters. Insufficient biomass yield may require extra capital investment to satisfy bioenergy demand but with a higher supply cost. Thus, a high and long-term subsidy is necessary to facilitate the sustainable development of biomass and the low-carbon transition of the energy sector. © 2024},

	abstract = {When designing biomass-to-biofuel supply chains, the biomass uncertainty, seasonality and geographical dispersion that affect economic viability need to be considered. This work pre-sents a novel methodology that can optimize the design of biofuel supply chains by adopting a decentralized network structure consisting of a mix of fixed and mobile processing facilities. The model considers a variable biomass yield profile and the mobile fast pyrolysis technology. The mixed-integer linear programming model developed identifies the optimal biofuel production and biomass harvesting schedule schemes under the objective of profit maximization. It was applied in the case study of marginal lands in Scotland, which are assumed to be planted with Miscanthus. The trade-offs observed between economies of scale against the transportation costs, the effect of the relocation costs and the contribution of storage capacity were investigated. The results showed that, in most cases, harvesting is most concentrated during the month of the highest biomass yield, provided that storage facilities are available. Storage capacity plays an important role to widen the operational time window of processing facilities since scenarios with restricted or costly storage resulted in facilities of higher capacity operating within a narrower time window, leading to higher investment costs. Relocation costs proved to have a minor share in the total transportation costs. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Biomass, as one of the most available renewable energies, could reduce dependency on fossil fuels and the consequent environmental impacts. There is a need for biomass supply chain management, which is managing bioenergy production from harvesting feedstock to energy conversion facilities. In case of remote communities, bioenergy adoption requires dealing with dispersed geographies of suppliers and places of consumption with small scales of energy demand. As such, coordination plays a key role in increasing the efficiency of the biomass supply chain network through bundling of demand and thus improving the economy of scale. This paper employs a game-theoretic approach to formulate a coordinated biomass supply chain with three echelons including suppliers, hubs, and energy convertors. To investigate the strategic interactions of participants, three decision making structure scenarios have been considered under Stackelberg game providing insights into the impact of power distribution, the role of side payments in enforcing the flow of decisions, and the resulting efficiency and performance improvements. In doing so, a case study bioenergy supply chain for three northern Canadian communities is explored to demonstrate the application of the proposed formulation, solution methods, and the practicality and significance of the adopted approach and outcomes for remote communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Forest biofuel delivered costs are generally uncompetitive with fossil fuels. Drying forest biofuel can potentially reduce delivered costs through weight reductions and net calorific value increases. The study examined the impact of roadside drying (RD) and use of high-volumetric capacity trucks on delivered costs of Pinus radiata pulp-logs and logging residue (LR) chips supplying a gasification plant. Five truck configurations: 6-axle semi-trailers; 9-axle B-doubles; proposed high-volumetric (HV) capacity versions of these trucks (HV semi-trailers and B-doubles); and 11-axle pocket road trains (PRT), were investigated across six supply areas using a forest biomass supply chain tool. Without RD all truck configurations were weight limited transporting logs, and all (except HV semi-trailers and B-doubles) were volume limited transporting LR chips. Post-RD all truck configurations were volume limited transporting logs or LR chips, (except HV B-doubles transporting logs). RD considerably reduced delivered costs: PRT (22%), B-doubles (24%), semi-trailers (25%) for logs and PRT (28%), B-doubles (29%), semi-trailers (30%) for LR chips. Delivered cost differences between truck configurations reflected transport cost differences. Without RD, truck trips transporting log were directly related to truck weight capacity. Additional volumetric capacity enabled HV semi-trailers and B-doubles to transport 6% and 4% more LR chips than standard versions, respectively, with equivalent truck trip reductions. RD weight reductions were: logs (33%); LR chips (53%), with consequent reductions in truck trips. PRTs required fewest truck trips to transport logs and LR chips without RD and the second fewest for logs post-RD due to their high weight and volumetric capacities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

A systematic investigation into the effects of DLC(sh) pretreatment on the biomass logistics, enzymatic hydrolysis, and microbial fermentation performance of lignocellulosic feedstocks will enable a comprehensive evaluation of DLC(sh) pretreatment technology's viability in commercial application. DLC(sh) pretreatment owning high bulk density and uniform shape, greatly facilitates feedstock handling, transportation and storage. The DLC(sh) pretreatment densified CS with low energy consumption, which avoided the use of high-temperature or high-pressure equipment and scaled up for pretreated biomass. DLC(sh)-CS showed highly enzymatic digestibility (glucan and xylan conversion>90 %) and highly fermentability (0.219 g ethanol/g dry corn stover) without detoxification of the pretreated biomass. Hence, these results demonstrated that DLC(sh) pretreatment has great commercial potential to convert corn stover to ethanol. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Biomass waste is a naturally occurring agricultural byproduct. It is estimated that about 60 million tons per year can be extracted sustainably without altering land use patterns or competing with existing demands. Utilizing this waste is logistically challenging due to the inherent low density and distributed availability of biomass. This work proposes a supply chain optimization problem which decides where to locate and relocate mobile and modular production units to convert biomass waste to energy. Both deterministic and two-stage stochastic formulations are presented, accounting for the inherent uncertainty of where and how much biomass is produced. The framework is applied to case studies analyzing the states of Minnesota and North Carolina. Results from both states show that mobile production modules lead to supply chain cost savings of 1–4%, or millions of dollars per year. Additionally, this work demonstrates the benefit of mobile modules as a means of protecting against uncertainty. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recycling and utilization of crop straw have been one of the most important ways to treat the resource waste and environmental pollution in rural areas in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In this study, a collection and transportation model was established to optimize the number and the recovery distance of storage points with the carbon emission reduction from the straw collection. A research object was taken as the collection and transportation system with a square area in the biomass power plant in Hebei Province of China. A systematic investigation was made on the resource distribution, biomass potential and household power consumption demand, further to evaluate the matching degree of straw resources supply and demand in various cities. Different collection systems were compared under the direct combustion and gasification power generation from the perspective of collection range and emission. The constructed system was then comprehensively evaluated in terms of economy, environment, and efficiency. According to the sustainable development goals, some recommendations were proposed to promote the low-carbon recovery and efficient utilization of straw resources. The research results show that there were excellent collection conditions in most areas rich in straw resources, with an annual output of 44.755 million tons. The straw output per unit area was 645.97 t/km2 in the study area. There were high power demands in Langfang, Cangzhou, and Tangshan Cities, but the supply of straw was tight, indicating the low matching degree of resource supply and demand. The straw collection and transportation system with the best emission reduction benefits was set as 12 collection storage points around the power plant, where the vertical distance between each collection storage point and the recycling boundary was 0.25R (R is the vertical distance from the power plant to the collection boundary). The transportation emissions were reduced by 83.98%, and the regional greenhouse effect was effectively controlled in the system, compared with no storage points. The collection efficiency increased by 18.75% than before, indicating cost-saving, low carbon, and free of collection blind area. The constructed system was greatly contributed to the circular radiation collection mode for the better utilization of waste resources. The high efficiency, low-carbon, and economic properties were found in Zhangjiakou and Qinhuangdao Cities, but less in Langfang and Cangzhou Cities. In addition, the multiple dimensional support 10 sustainable development goals were related to environmental protection, poverty reduction, public health, and resource utilization. The power generation efficiency can also determine the market competitiveness of biomass technology in sustainable agriculture. A closed-loop supply chain of biomass circular energy can be constructed to promote the low-carbon path for agricultural modernization and sustainable energy in rural areas. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources are of great importance in protecting the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Recently, more efficient conversion technologies and different types of resources have been introduced to generate energy in a sustainable way. Biomass-to-energy systems need to be designed efficiently due to high volumes of raw material flows and transportation costs. This study proposes a novel integrated approach for the solution of biomass supply chain network design using artificial intelligence, geographic information systems, multi criteria decision making and mathematical modelling. First, the five-year forecasts of biomass raw materials including animal waste, agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste were made using support vector regression. Alternative biogas facility locations were determined spatially based on various criteria using geographic data and a decision-making technique. Then, considering annual net present value streams, the bioenergy system has been configured using a mixed integer linear programming model. The proposed methodology was applied on a real case in the city of Denizli, Turkey. The results showed that nine conversion facilities could be opened with 2000 kWh capacity each, and approximately 83.2% of net income could came from electricity sales, with the remainder from fertilizer sales. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to see the variations in model parameters such as biomass purchase cost, transportation cost, fertilizer sales prices and discount rate. It was found that the most dominant factor affecting net present value was fertilizer sales price, which was followed by discount rate. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bioenergy pathways based on waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies are potential solutions to address two major societal challenges: climate change and a lack of sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) diversion solutions. This study identifies and addresses the absence of an integrated decision-making framework that includes upstream operations (collection, separation, and delivery) and energy recovery technologies of the MSW supply chain. Modeling tools are developed for each WTE stage and integrated for the first time under a single cost and carbon footprint assessment framework. This framework is validated using two case studies to capture urban and rural characteristics. The first pathway includes gasification and an Internal Combustion Engine, and the second pathway consists of combustion and an Organic Rankine Cycle. The outcomes of this study show that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of the WTE pathways are slightly higher than fossil-based heating. This difference is explained by two factors. First, upstream logistics (often overlooked) are a major contributor to the net GHG emissions (36% in rural cases), and their emissions would offset the potential credits when replacing the current heating systems with the WTE pathways. Secondly, MSW is not entirely carbon neutral, and when the fossil-based carbon is accounted for, WTE pathways show higher GHG emissions for both rural (12–16%) and urban (17–19%) communities, which confirms that the WTE pathways still require more technology optimization and improvement. However, integrated framework revealed that WTE pathways are economically competent to reduce the current heating cost by up to 36% in rural and 25% in urban communities. © 2022},

	abstract = {This study examines the merits of using biochar to delay aging in construction while promoting the economic viability of biofuel production and enhancing the biomass value chain. Biochar residue from pyrolysis of biomass to biofuel was introduced to neat asphalt and rubberized asphalt binders. The study results showed biochar can delay oxidation and UV-induced aging at binder and mixture level as evidenced by lowering rheological and chemical aging indexes. The rheological aging index was measured based on the change in crossover modulus due to aging, and the chemical aging index was measured based on the change in carbonyl and sulfoxide functional groups due to aging. Four types of aging were examined including oxidation and UV aging at the binder level as well as aging and weathering at the mixture level. In terms of oxidation aging, biochar was more effective for rubberized asphalt, while in the case of UV aging, neat asphalt appeared to benefit more than rubberized asphalt from the presence of biochar. The latter can be attributed to the role of biochar as a UV-light blockage and free radical scavenger. Rubberized asphalt inherently contains carbon black which enhances the internal resistance against UV aging, hence the role of biochar was not as significant in rubberized asphalt compared to that of the neat asphalt. However, in the case of oxidation aging, biochar noticeably improved the rubberized asphalt compared to neat asphalt. The study outcomes provide a simultaneous solution to promote resource conservation and enhance aging resistance of bituminous composites. Biochar, carbonaceous particles, made from biowaste can be used as a free radical scavenger to delay ultraviolet aging of bituminous composites. Therefore, this study promotes sustainability by creating applications for biochar while increasing pavement durability by delaying asphalt aging. © 2020},

In this study, a novel methodology is proposed that combines advanced “hard path” technologies and “soft path” policy to facilitate an effective and sustainable waste-to-energy approach. Multiple tech-economic MSW cascaded systems were established and combined for MSW terminal treatment, and a subsidy policy was applied to waste source management. Furthermore, an MSW reverse supply chain (MSWRSC) was proposed that integrates waste source and end treatment management, and a multi-objective mixed-integer dynamic model was established to optimize the MSW treatment process by achieving cost control, carbon emission reduction, and job creation. A practical case study was then conducted to provide the analysis paradigm including the system deployment and facilities operation. Further, some important conclusions and suggestions are summarized for reference by the local government and facilities. Therefore, the methodology that combines the cascade treatment systems with policy instruments shows important theoretical and pragmatic significance for the multi-dimensional sustainable development of MSW management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Waste-to-energy conversion via pyrolysis has attracted increasing attention recently owing to its multiple uses. Among the products of this process, biochar stands out for its versatility, with its yield influenced by various factors. Extensive and labor-intensive experimental testing is sometimes necessary to properly grasp the output distribution from various feedstocks. Nonetheless, data-driven predictive models using large-scale historical experiment records can provide insightful analysis of projected yields from a variety of biomass materials, hence overcoming the challenges of empirical modeling. As such, five modern approaches available in modern machine learning are employed in this study to develop the biochar yield prediction models. The Lasso regression, Tweedie regression, random forest, XGBoost, and Gradient boosting regression were employed. Out of these five XGBoost was superior with a training mean squared error (MSE) of 1.17 and a test MSE of 2.94. The XGBoost-based biochar yield model shows excellent performance with a strong predictive accuracy of the R2 values as 0.9739 (training) and 0.8875 (test). The mean absolute percentage error value was only 2.14% in the training phase and 3.8% in the testing phase. Precision prognostic technologies have broad effects on sectors including biomass logistics, conversion technologies, and effective biomass utilization as renewable energy. Leveraging SHAP based on cooperative game theory, the study shows that while ash and moisture lower biochar yield, FPT, nitrogen, and carbon content significantly boost it. Small variables like heating rate and volatile matter have a secondary impact on production efficiency. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Abstract: A large-scale mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for the supply chain and processing of agricultural residue to produce ethanol. The novelty in the presented model is the consideration of multiple biorefinery location options, unrestricted number of biorefineries, and the distribution of ethanol. They are implemented as extensions to an existing model which considers multiple biomass source locations, biomass types with varying seasonality, and conversion pathways. The objective is to minimize the total annualized cost while meeting a monthly demand for ethanol. A case study of ethanol production in the state of Maharashtra, India, is considered with 33 potential biorefinery locations and 35 blending sites. The impacts of varying ethanol demand and availability of key feedstock types on system design and operation are rigorously quantified. For a base case considering an ethanol blending of 5%, the model recommended four locations for setting up biorefineries with an average monthly production of 4.2 Gg ethanol/month. The cost of ethanol was estimated to be ₹54/l ($0.73/l). Varying the ethanol blending target from 2.5 to 10% increased the optimal number of biorefineries from 3 to 6, respectively. This also increased the ethanol cost by 17% due to increased feedstock and transport cost. Cotton-based biomass was the most valuable feedstock due to its low cost, and its unavailability increased the ethanol cost by 24.1% over the base case. The results provide region-specific recommendations for setting up lignocellulosic biorefineries that can be used by government and businesses.

	abstract = {Biomass as an abundant renewable energy source can play a vital role in controlling the greenhouse gas emissions. The distributed nature of biomass and its low energy density have complicated the utilization of this cheap and available source of energy. Governments can stimulate the bioenergy industry and remove barriers for adoption of bioenergy by implementing supporting regulations and incentives. In this paper, two types of government incentives, representing direct and indirect incentives, are analyzed and their efficiencies in fostering bioenergy generation are compared. A Stackelberg (leader–follower) game is proposed to formulate the integration of incentives as a bi-level problem in coordination of biomass supply chains. We further illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach through an empirical case study of three Canadian remote communities. The case study demonstrates the effects of incentives on coordination of biomass suppliers and end-user communities and promoting bioenergy share in electricity generation mix of communities. The findings of this study highlight the importance of government’s support, in form of indirect incentives, for provisioning of infrastructure needed for biomass supply and conversion, with a significant impact on increasing the share of bioenergy generation.

	abstract = {Sustainable development has been a goal for many industries, which can be achieved via the substitution of non-renewable feedstocks with greener alternatives such as substituting coal with biomass for gasification process. The sustainably produced biomass-derived syngas has a lower carbon emission when utilized as a fuel. Although most studies have reported the possible impact of biomass quality on the feasibility of biomass conversion process, there is still little published works on the incorporation of biomass quality directly into developed mathematical evaluation model. Therefore, this paper aims to perform techno-economic feasibility evaluation on biomass gasification process, with the consideration of various supply chain uncertainties via Monte Carlo simulation (i.e., biomass supply, biomass quality, biomass pricing, transportation fuel price, and syngas sale price). This is achieved via integration of a generic correlation equation relating biomass quality to specific syngas yield into the Monte Carlo model. Upon consideration of the uncertainties, this study revealed that mesocarp fibre has a higher net present value (NPV) in the range of Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) 70 million to greater than MYR 120 million amongst the three types of palm-based biomass (empty fruit bunches (EFB), palm kernel shells (PKS), and mesocarp fibre). Additionally, environmental assessment performed deduced that mesocarp fibre is slightly more preferable in the impact category for HTPI and TTP with a probability of 98 % to achieve the equivalent emissions within the lower range of 0–0.2 kg 1,4-C6H4Cl2,eq whereas EFB and PKS has a probability of 18 % and 28 %, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biogas from anaerobic digestion of biomass is one of the potential renewable energy sources been considered for adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, the issue of sustainability of feedstock supply in the biomass to biogas conversion system has been reported as one of the major factors militating against the adoption. Sometimes this challenge of not being able to meet feedstock demand is discovered during the production stage, as most designs reviewed did not incorporate a plan for sustainable supply of feedstock. Considering the enormous resources involved in the development of a bio-digester, it is, therefore, expedient to implement robust model(s) at the design stage, such that it can ascertain sustainability of continuous biomass supply necessary for meeting the biogas demand for all the specified periods. The concept of bio-mimicry with a focus on predator-prey interaction was adopted in developing an inventory-based model that enables the designers of the system to ascertain the critical start-up inventory of the prey(biomass) that will ensure sustained biogas production (predator existence) based on known demand level. The developed model was found useful in determining the minimum start-up biomass prior to production and in determining the level of sustainability for any given start-up inventory. It also provided the basis for decision-making in the commencement of biogas production from a given feedstock source. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The increasing GHG emissions from energy systems over the past decades have prompted the transition towards renewable energy. Agro-residues, such as rice straw, maize cobs, and sugarcane trash, can be converted into hydrogen, biofuels and electricity, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the consistent availability of feedstock for bioenergy systems is impacted by the ineffective harvest and collection of residues, transportation, storage, and processing. A robust biomass supply chain network (BSCN) is hence required to enable reliable feedstock supply from the farms to the biorefineries, considering the biomass yields, time constraints for residue handling, and the local availability of resources (machinery, labour, and vehicles). The bulky nature of the agro-residues and their distributed availability necessitate decentralised procurement and densification to reduce transportation costs. This work, using an Indian case study, explores a decentralised BSCN to enable a reliable feedstock supply from agro-residues for green hydrogen production. Decentralised residue procurement and centralised biorefineries in each district ensure low transportation costs and high residue utilisation rates. The model incorporates the time constraints for biomass collection and evaluates four scenarios of machinery and labour engagement. Increasing machinery adoption in residue collection improves the time efficiency of collection, leading to low delivered biomass costs (DBC) and high green hydrogen potentials. An average DBC of INR 7421/tonne (USD ($) 87.33) and an aggregate potential of 0.53 million tonnes of green hydrogen is feasible in Karnataka, India, for scenarios of high mechanisation. The proposed approach is replicable globally for a variety of biomass mixes. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

At the same time, supply chain integration ensures sustainable feedstock management and minimizes environmental and logistical impacts, enabling a holistic approach to a circular bioeconomy. This study presents an integrated approach to simultaneously optimize the biomass supply chain network and process flowsheet, which includes anaerobic digestion, cogeneration, and hydrothermal carbonization. A three-layer supply chain network superstructure was hence developed to integrate the optimization of process variables with supply chain features such as transportation modes, feedstock supply, plant location, and demand location. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model aimed at maximizing the economic performance of the system was formulated and applied to a case study of selected regions in Slovenia. The results show a great potential for the utilization of organic biomass with an annual after tax profit of 23.13 million USD per year, with the production of 245.70 GWh/yr of electricity, 298.83 GWh/yr of heat, and 185.08 kt/yr of hydrochar.

These criteria are not restricted to sustainable dimensions and consider technical dimensions as well. The second stage designs a supply chain structure based on the installation of a WtE power plant, with the goal of maximising profit while minimising CO2 emissions. The proposed adaptive model allows the decision-maker to choose a WtE technology in the first stage and accordingly outline the supply chain structure.

Unlike petrochemical plants that use crude oil, biorefineries often have to deal with the uneven spatial-temporal distribution of feedstock supply. The modular production strategy provides more flexibility in chemical manufacturing by allowing fast capacity expansion and unit movement. However, modeling and optimizing modular biomass supply chain under uncertainties becomes challenging due to high dimensionality and the existence of discrete decisions. This work optimizes the multiperiod biomass supply chain using the rolling horizon planning and two-stage stochastic programming framework. We then applied generalized Benders decomposition to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming supply chain optimization. Furthermore, the solution of the stochastic programming could be used to quantitatively describe the life-cycle assessment uncertainties of the biomass supply chain performance, demonstrating seasonality and random variability. © 2024 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

Municipal waste management includes transportation and recycling of waste, which needs huge funds. Moreover, significant carbon emissions occur while transporting garbage from one site to another. Thus, this study focuses on reducing the cost due to municipal solid waste (MSW) transportation. The research aims to develop a mathematical model of the supply chain of MSW management. The process of segregation and recycling is also considered in this study. We consider six Indian states and identify the dumping location of the garbage. The study proposes an efficient framework for selecting the segregation hub location and location of MSW treatment plants. The outcomes would be beneficial to achieve an efficient waste management strategy with reduced cost. The numerical simulation results of the model provides the minimum transportation cost as Rs. 4.92 × 106 according to the locations selected for the study.

This paper investigates an advanced biomass supply chain design wherein biomass resources are initially converted into bio-oil through widely distributed fast pyrolysis facilities, and are subsequently transported to a centralised biorefinery for further refining into biofuels. This novel biomass supply chain addressed three key issues: (1) The number of fast pyrolysis facilities, (2) The allocation of resources, and (3) The routes of resources transport. In respect of these problems, a two-stage stochastic mixed integer programming model is established to minimise the total cost of the biomass supply chain considering the uncertainty collection price of fast pyrolysis facilities. A hybrid simulated annealing algorithm which incorporates the sample average approximation method is proposed to solve the stochastic model and is effectiveness for large-scale examples. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed using the proposed algorithm and the results show that the proposed stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model under uncertain collection price. The model allows optimising the biomass supply chain economic performances and minimise financial risk on investment by determining the fast pyrolysis facility locations, reasonable resource allocation and optimal transport routes under uncertain collection price. © 2024 IAgrE},

	abstract = {Palm kernel shell (PKS) is a waste of palm oil processing, that has enormous potential to become a green energy resource for industries with thermal conversion. To realize PKS potential as biomass fuel, it is important to build an effective, efficient, and sustainable supply chain model. As with other biomass, PKS supply chain involves collection processes, storage facilities, and a transportation network, which is dynamic and optimizable. Soft systems dynamics methodology (SSDM) has been implemented in this study, by which its key feature of system dynamics is recognized as one of the most ideal modeling techniques for studying such complex and multivariate system. We demonstrate how to apply SSDM in analyzing and designing a sustainable supply system of PKS through mathematical modeling and simulations, which capture the long-term effect of and the interactions among supply chain design variables and parameters. The simulation results show that the proposed supply chain model would be able to deliver continuous availability of PKS at the end customer side by achieving the goal of minimum 95% customer production level despite decreasing PKS generation rate from the source and increasing other consumption rate. Furthermore, decision makers can identify and implement necessary changes and recommendations to improve the existing supply chain system. The application of soft systems dynamics approach in biomass supply chain will enable greater use of green energy for continuous industrial purposes. © 2022 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

	abstract = {Feedstock cost and cost variability is expected to increase with the number of biorefineries. To quantify this effect, this spatial-economic analysis simulates feedstock cost and cost variability of an industry based on corn stover as a function of the number of biorefineries. Results are reported for nine scenarios (a base case and sensitivity analysis of four variables – harvest efficiency, sustainability constraints, opportunity cost, and corn grain yield) under deterministic and stochastic simulations, assuming biorefineries using 658 000 Mg (725 000 tons) year−1 of corn stover in 2019. The resulting supply curves are highly elastic (i.e. little change in cost) for the first 50 of the 121 biorefineries, with price increases in subsequent biorefineries depending on scenario. In the base-case deterministic scenario, weighted-average stover costs are $66 Mg−1 ($60 ton−1), $69 Mg−1 ($62 ton−1), and $156 Mg−1 ($142 ton−1), at the first, 60th, and 121st biorefineries, respectively. The stochastic simulations, subject to observed 30-year corn yield variability, follow a similar pattern, with price distributions that vary by scenario. The base-case stochastic simulations illustrate minimal cost variability for the first 60 biorefineries, but rapid increases in cost variability in the second half of potential biorefineries, with similar patterns observed in the other scenarios. Of the four variables explored, price was most sensitive to harvest efficiency, followed by sustainability constraints, corn yield, and opportunity cost. Results suggest that, under conventional logistics, about half of the US corn stover resource is reliably available with minimum cost increase and variability.

	abstract = {The detrimental effects of excessive fossil fuel consumption have recently become a major global concern. Moreover, fuel supply chains are vulnerable to disruptive and operational risks. This study proposes a robust-stochastic approach to design a resilient sustainable biodiesel supply chain from Jatropha and waste cooking oil, while facilities and transportation links are vulnerable to multiple site-dependent disruptions. The main contributions are implementing preventive resiliency strategies to manage risks, integrating sustainability and resiliency, and selecting biodiesel conversion technology based on byproducts’ demands. Herein, candidate locations are identified to cultivate Jatropha using the best-worst method and geographical information system. Moreover, the supply chain network is designed to optimize economic performance, network non-resiliency, and social impacts. The Monte Carlo simulation approach, k-means clustering, augmented epsilon constraint, and Mulvey robust optimization are adopted to generate and reduce probable scenarios, manage multiple objectives, and handle uncertainty, respectively. The results showed that the non-resilient supply chain experiences a 20.11 % additional cost in disruption scenarios; however, even with a higher initial cost, adopting resiliency strategies reduces disruption cost effects by 9.46 %. Managerial insights have demonstrated that resilience and sustainability are positively correlated in biofuel supply chain management, and rising biodiesel demand enhances social welfare and economic performance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bioenergy from forest-based biomass could reduce fossil fuel dependency, GHG emissions, and generated wastes. However, the inherent complexity, uncertainty, and high cost of forest-based biomass supply chains could hinder the economic viability of bioenergy projects. The supply chain activities including transportation, storage, handling, and preprocessing of biomass are interdependent and require proper planning. Therefore, in previous studies, mathematical programming models were developed to plan and optimize the biomass supply chain activities. In this paper, a bi-objective optimization model is developed for tactical planning of the forest-based biomass supply chains in order to determine the trade-offs between the total costs and the possible deviations from the safety stock. The first objective is to minimize the upstream supply chain costs, and the second objective is to minimize the negative deviations of monthly inventory from the safety stock. The decision variables include the optimal monthly biomass flows, preprocessing, and inventory levels. The model is applied to the case of a biomass gasification at a Kraft pulp mill in British Columbia, Canada. The output of the model is a set of Pareto optimal solutions, which shows the trade-offs between the objectives of cost and safety stock deviation. This approach has the potential to assist the decision makers by providing a set of solutions to opt from based on their preferences and their attitude towards supply disruption risk. The results indicate a maximum of 18% cost savings is possible if the inventory level deviates from the safety stock. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to assess the impact of variations in the biomass availability and cost, and feedstock demand on the Pareto optimal solutions. According to the sensitivity results, feedstock demand is the most sensitive parameter. © 2021 The Authors},

This paper recommends using an agent-based simulation–optimization in analyzing and reporting results by system elements (techno-economic assessment) or unit processes (life cycle assessment) as well as by the overall product system, of methanol supply chain. Major decision making are included in the agent-based simulation–optimization model to evaluate methanol synthesis pathways. This evaluation includes biomass and methanol ordering policy, capital budgeting during the lifetime of the methanol supply chain, carbon emissions per metric ton of methanol with specific focus on contribution to Indonesia Gross Domestic Product. The principal results obtained from the agent-based simulation show a better conversion technology pathway that leads to lower carbon emissions, higher internal rate of return, shorter payback period, and less price sensitivity of the methanol supply chain.

	abstract = {To achieve supply chain decarbonization, environmentally conscious manufacturers are transforming their energy infrastructure. While certain manufacturers are adopting a pure bioenergy strategy in their production processes, others are opting for a hybrid energy approach that combines traditional energy with bioenergy. This choice is often influenced by limitations in land capacity and the developmental stage of biomass conversion technologies. This paper introduces a game-theoretic model that explores the optimal approach to achieving supply chain decarbonization by strategically selecting energy portfolios. Our findings reveal that in scenarios where the market size is small, manufacturers tend to adopt a hybrid energy strategy, particularly when the average yield of biomass is low. However, as the biomass yield increases, manufacturers lean towards a hybrid (or pure) bioenergy strategy in smaller (or larger) markets. In larger markets, the manufacturer’s energy strategies become more complex and are influenced by various factors. Our results emphasize that farmers should base their planting decisions on considerations such as available land, initial investment, and agricultural biomass yield. This paper urges manufacturers to effectively navigate the complexities of the carbon tax policy and make informed decisions that promote a sustainable energy strategy. By utilizing technological advancements, governments and manufacturers can collect and analyze data on factors such as market size, biomass yield, and carbon tax policy, ultimately working towards a more efficient, productive, and environmentally sustainable future. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Succinic acid (SA) is one of the main identified biomass-derived chemical building blocks. In this work we approach the study of its production by Actinobacillus succinogenes DSM 22257 from glucose, focusing on the development and application of a simple kinetic model capable of representing the evolution of the process over time for a great diversity of process variables key to the production of this platform bio-based chemical: initial biomass concentration, yeast extract concentration, agitation speed, and carbon dioxide flow rate. All these variables were studied experimentally, determining the values of key fermentation parameters: titer (23.8–39.7 g·L−1), yield (0.59–0.72 gSA·gglu−1), productivity (0.48–0.96 gSA·L−1·h−1), and selectivity (0.61–0.69 gSA·gglu−1). Even with this wide diversity of operational conditions, a non-structured and non-segregated kinetic model was suitable for fitting to experimental data with high accuracy, considering the values of the goodness-of-fit statistical parameters. This model is based on the logistic equation for biomass growth and on potential kinetic equations to describe the evolution of SA and the sum of by-products as production events that are not associated with biomass growth. The application of the kinetic model to diverse operational conditions sheds light on their effect on SA production. It seems that nitrogen stress is a good condition for SA titer and selectivity, there is an optimal inoculum mass for this purpose, and hydrodynamic stress starts at 300 r.p.m. in the experimental set-up employed. Due to its practical importance, and to validate the developed kinetic model, a fed-batch fermentation was also carried out, verifying the goodness of the model proposed via the process simulation (stage or cycle 1) and application to further cycles of the fed-batch operation. The results showed that biomass inactivation started at cycle 3 after a grace period in cycle 2. © 2023 by the authors.},

The optimization simultaneously considered dual-feedstock sourcing, selection between distributed and centralized configurations, and the impact of maintaining SOC balance in agricultural soil on biomass availability. The applicability of the modeling approach was demonstrated through a case study that optimized a dual-feedstock renewable jet fuel supply chain via a gasification-Fischer–Tropsch (gasification-FT) conversion pathway in 2050 under three biomass availability scenarios. The case study results show that the differences in procurement costs and GHG emissions between energy crops and agricultural residues have a large impact on the layout of the supply chain. The supply-chain configuration tends to be more centralized with large-scale biorefineries when a supply region has an intensive and centralized distribution of biomass resources. The cost-supply curves demonstrated the technical potential of biofuels that could be obtained at a certain level of cost. Additionally, sensitivity analysis shows that the GHG emission credit from producing extra electricity during the gasification-FT process will be significantly reduced with a rising share of renewable electricity generation in the future. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Increasing municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the city has caused a serious problem to the authority, especially for emerging countries. Improper management of MSW will increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Apart from landfill, there are other options to convert MSW into valuable products or energy, such as recycling and incineration. This paper presents crisp and fuzzy optimization models for designing optimal supply chain networks for sustainable MSW management, considering economic (cost minimization) and environmental objectives (emissions reduction). The crisp model is based on a superstructure and consists of material balances, capacity limits and planning constraints for MSW transfer stations, disposal sites and treatment technologies. Fuzzy optimization with max-min aggregation is then incorporated to handle conflicting economic and environmental objectives, as well as uncertainties in GHG emission factors and cost coefficients of MSW treatment. A case study for the design of an optimal MSW supply chain network in the city of Qingdao, China is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. The conflicting objectives of minimizing the total net cost and GHG emissions for MSW transport and treatment are analyzed using the crisp model, yielding a set of Pareto optimal solutions. A compromise solution achieving a 21.6% cost reduction and a 28.4% emissions reduction is identified using the fuzzy model. An inferior solution is also found with smaller cost (19.1%) and emissions reductions (25.1%) due to the use of conservative estimates of uncertain cost coefficients and emission factors. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models in dealing with the MSW management problem. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a drop-in fuel from biomass feedstocks can reduce carbon emissions and provide resiliency to the aviation sector in light of the volatile nature of conventional aviation fuel (CAF) prices. This study aims to develop a supply chain model for SAF derived from unutilized logging residues across Georgia, a prominent forestry state located in the southern region of the United States. We employed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimize the total discounted cost of the SAF supply chain using the Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) production pathway over ten years of operation. Three SAF demand scenarios were selected, i.e., meeting 20 % (high), 10 % (medium), and 5 % (low) of total SAF demand at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Results indicate a unit production cost of US $1.92 L−1, US $2.03 L−1, and US $2.25 L−1 for the high, medium, and low demand scenarios, respectively. Over a period of ten years, to produce 3.74, 1.87, and 0.94 billion liters of SAF in scenarios A, B, and C, respectively, 38.5, 19.2, and 9.6 million Mg of logging residues are required. The capital investment and operating cost at biorefineries accounted for an average of 77 % and 22 % of the total unit cost, respectively, across scenarios. The GHG intensity of the SAF was 767 g CO2e L−1 on average across scenarios, providing about 70 % of carbon savings relative to CAF. The supply chain model suggested 54 biomass processing units (BPUs) and 13 bio-refineries across Georgia under the high demand scenario, 27 BPUs and 7 bio-refineries under the medium scenario, and 14 BPUs and 4 bio-refineries under the low SAF demand scenario.

	abstract = {Climate change is a widespread issue posed by greenhouse gas (GHG) emission produced from human activities. As emission mitigation protocols increase in number, one way to comply with these protocols is by implementing biorefineries. A biorefinery converts biomass into biofuel, power and chemicals through a combination of processes. Due to the heterogeneous composition of biomass, various processing pathways are available for biomass conversion. This makes designing an optimal biorefinery process a difficult task. In addition, the inherent uncertainties in biomass feedstock supply would further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, this work developed an optimisation model to synthesize an optimal biorefinery process design under uncertain feedstock conditions by adapting Hurwicz Criterion approach. The uncertainty in the feedstock supply is represented as scenarios in Hurwicz Criterion approach. This approach allows the decision-makers to input anticipated feedstock supply values into the criterion to choose the best alternative design. Hurwicz Criterion approach finds the intermediate area between total optimism and total pessimism criteria by including a coefficient of realism. The value for the coefficient of realism is subject to the decision makers’ appetite towards risk. Based on the results from Hurwicz Criterion, biorefinery process design with best weighted average is selected. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a case study was solved. In the case study, lignocellulosic biomass such as empty fruit bunch was used. The optimal biorefinery design with the best weighted average was the one sized at 8000 kg/h of biomass input. The products chosen for the biorefinery designs were bio-oil, pentanol and succinic acid. Following this, results from the Hurwicz Criterion are compared with results from a method that requires the use of historical data and probability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study on the synthesis and optimisation of a renewable energy and resource supply chain network (SCN) to satisfy agricultural greenhouse resource and energy demands. This is motivated by the high costs and emissions to run greenhouses due to the resources and energy required for optimal growth conditions. The investigation aims to contribute to the growing area of research on circular practices in the agricultural sector. The SCN includes biomass from agricultural waste transported to a utility hub, consisting of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) as resource supplies, as well as a boiler and steam turbine-generator and solar photovoltaic (PV), as energy conversion technologies. The resources and energy are distributed to greenhouses. The objectives are to minimise both the total annualised costs (TAC) and environmental impact (EI), calculated as CO2 emissions of the integrated network. Multi-periodicity accounts for the monthly and daily variation in constraints on the system, such as feedstock and solar radiation availability and energy limitations. The model is applied to a case study of an agro-industrial zone in Kwa-Zulu Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. The network meets greenhouse demands at a minimum TAC and EI of 8.052 ×106 R/y and 14,370 tCO2e/y, respectively. The biomass supply chain (BSC) contributes most significantly to the TAC at 43.7% while biomass combustion makes up 99.8% of the EI. Additional key results include bagasse and corn stover being selected as the only feedstocks and rail as the transport mode. The 26,560 MWh/y of electricity supplied to the greenhouses is made up by 71.4% from the boiler and turbine-generator with the remainder from solar PV. The potential of solar PV as a clean and low-cost energy source is demonstrated by the model selection at its full capacity. The study confirms that holistic modelling and optimisation of renewable energy SCNs for greenhouses is necessary to meet a trade-off between the network costs and CO2 emissions. © The Author(s) 2023.},

Although one of the main barriers to the development of the biomass industry is the high cost of feedstock, it remains unclear how effective different subsidies are in addressing that barrier. In this paper, we categorize biomass subsidies and explore their effectiveness by developing a biomass feedstock supply model. First, we examined biomass subsidies in China and the United States and found that all biomass subsidies can be grouped into four categories based on the types of costs they seek to mitigate: production and transport subsidies for biomass utilization improvement and product and operating subsidies for specific biomass industry development. Then, we developed a game-theoretic model of the interactions between the government and biorefineries and compared the effectiveness of the subsidies. The results indicate that transport subsidies are more cost-effective at increasing biomass utilization. However, the production subsidy allows for more even use of biomass across different biorefineries. A combination of operating and product subsidies is more cost-effective in enhancing the profitability of specific biomass industries if the industry to be supported is quite unprofitable; otherwise, the product subsidy is better. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The development of kinetic models aims at predicting the behavior of a system or analyzing the underlying mechanisms. This process is essential for understanding microalgal growth and optimizing culture conditions. In the case of microalgal cultivation in wastewater, the analysis becomes even more difficult as growth is often inhibited by several factors, such as nutrient limitation and light inadequacy. In this context, a mathematical model was developed to describe the microbial growth of the species Parachlorella kessleri in different reactor setups using either sterile or non-sterile anaerobic digestion effluent as a substrate. Three different mass balances were taken into consideration to describe biomass growth, phosphorus, and nitrogen consumption. Concerning biomass growth, the logistic model was applied to evaluate the inhibition in biomass formation due to lack of illumination. The maximum optical density under which these species could grow was quantified with an ODmax parameter, which was estimated at 4.07 AU/cm for the Erlenmeyer flask and 2.79 AU/cm for cylindrical photobioreactors. Regarding the nitrogen mass balance, two different terms concerning microalgal assimilation and ammonia stripping were implemented into the equation. The proposed model predicted biomass growth with high accuracy in model training (R2 = 0.90) and validation (R2 = 0.89). © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lactic acid is a versatile chemical with wide application in many industries. It can be produced by the fermentation of different sugars by various lactobacilli and investigations on lactic acid production from different substrates and by different strains are still in progress. The present study aimed to study lactic acid production from lactose by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AC 11S and to choose a mathematical model describing in the best way the experimental data obtained. The influence of initial substrate concentration was investigated, and optimal pH and temperature were determined. An unstructured mathematical model was developed comprising equations for bacterial growth, substrate consumption, and product formation. The model was solved with different terms for specific growth rates considering substrate and/or product inhibition. The best bacterial growth and lactic acid production were achieved at pH = 6.5 and 30 °C. Production of lactic acid was mainly growth-associated, and at initial substrate concentration over 15 g/L, a considerable product inhibition was observed. The parameters of different models were determined and compared. The modified Gompertz equation gave the best fit when solving only the equation for biomass growth at different initial substrate concentrations. Solving the entire set of differential equations for bacterial growth, substrate consumption, and product formation, the best results were obtained when using a variant of the logistic equation for biomass growth. This variant included a term for product inhibition and described in the best way all experimental data. Solving the model for different biomass concentrations showed that an increase in biomass led to a shorter lag phase and the stationary phase was reached faster. The results obtained, optimum conditions and the kinetic model, are good bases for studying pH-controlled fermentation, as well as a continuous process. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hyaluronic acid (HA), a mucopolysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan family, consists of repeating disaccharide units and has been used directly or indirectly in numerous human health practices. This study focused on evaluating carob pods for microbial HA production and kinetic modeling of HA fermentation. Therefore, the optimal medium composition was determined using Plackett–Burman Design (PBD) for HA production from carob extract with Streptococcus zooepidemicus. Maximum HA production of shake flask fermentation was 2.6 g/L (1.25 × 106) in the optimum medium, comprising 10°Bx of carob pods extract, 0.5 g/L of MgSO4.7H2O, 10.0 g/L of casein, 2.5 g/L of KH2PO4, 2.0 g/L of NaCl, 1.5 g/L of K2HPO4, 0.002 g/L of FeSO4 and 10.0 g/L of beef extract. In the continuation of the study, the fermentation performed with the optimal medium composition was modeled using three different models including the logistic model for biomass production, the Luedeking–Piret model for HA production, and the modified Luedeking–Piret model for substrate consumption. Based on the results, the experimental HA production data agreed with the Luedeking–Piret model with an R2 of 0.989. Since the α value was 63-fold higher than the value of β, the HA production is growth-associated. Consequently, carob extract can be evaluated as a promising carbon source for producing HA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

In this study, an integrated and comprehensive decision-making framework is proposed to support the strategic planning and tactical management of regional biomass supply networks from an energy-land-carbon nexus perspective. It combines a multi-objective fuzzy chance-constraint programming model with spatial analysis of marginal land and multi-criteria assessment of biorefinery sites. The model is verified through a case study of a major agricultural region, Shandong Province in China. Local agricultural residues remain a key feedstock for bioethanol production. The results highlight the importance of considering the multi-objective tradeoffs and the intricate resource and environmental nexus for stakeholders to achieve sustainability in real practice. A cost-minimization objective drives the construction of large-scale biomass plants to enhance efficiency. An emissions-minimization goal favors smaller, decentralized plants to reduce transport distances and improve local land use. Maximizing social welfare promotes marginal land development, creating more employment opportunities. Decision-makers' management goals, risk preferences, and external fluctuations significantly influence the spatial planning of bioethanol supply chains, marginal land utilization, and operational strategies. Overall, the proposed methodology offers decision-makers an effective tool for achieving optimal decisions while accounting for complex system interdependencies, conflicting objectives, and uncertainties. © 2024},

Second, we predicted the biomass gasification products using chemical reaction kinetics and thermodynamic models. Finally, we determined the optimal annual total cost of the hydrogen production supply chain by optimizing the microscopic operation of the biomass gasification plant. Through the proposed method, it is possible to effectively conduct a comprehensive assessment of regional biomass material hydrogen production; moreover, the optimal design of the biomass hydrogen production supply chain can also be determined based on the availability of biomass and hydrogen demand. More precisely, the logistics operations under fluctuating demand conditions were realized, enabling strategic decision-making for planning a biomass hydrogen production system.

	abstract = {Biofuels are a promising low-carbon replacement for fossil fuels in the transport sector. However, how should a country without an existing biofuel industry, such as New Zealand, go about implementing large-scale production and use of biofuels? We used value chain modelling and optimisation to identify lowest-cost options to replace existing liquid fossil fuels used in New Zealand, and how to make the transition. Multiple scenarios, e.g. 5–50% biofuel substitution, different land use assumptions, were examined. Novel features were added to the Biomass Value Chain Model to consider the impacts of land quality on biomass production, land use competition, existing and new plantation forests, and replacements for multiple liquid fossil fuels used. Credible routes exist for large-scale biofuel production in New Zealand, which could contribute significantly to meeting its GHG reduction targets. Key results include (i) Lowest cost substitution of 30% of fossil fuel use by 2050 reduced GHG emissions by 80% at a levelized cost within the range of prices seen for imported fossil petrol and diesel over the last 10 years; (ii) Drop-in biofuels from non-food feedstocks, particularly forestry on non-arable land, are the most attractive in the long term; and (iii) Pyrolysis plus upgrading of lignocellulosic feedstocks and biodiesel from canola were amongst the lowest-cost conversion options. The most important contributors to the cost are the: conversion process capital and operating costs; delivered cost of feedstock(s) suitable for each process; conversion yields; and options for co-product sales and distributed processing. Land use decisions, conditioned by land prices, affected the preferred feedstocks, but also where biomass was grown and converted into fuels, fuel costs, and GHG reductions. Conversion plant locations were driven by feedstock availability and costs through time and existing infrastructure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

While cellulosic biofuels have the potential fuel performance equivalent to petroleum-based jet fuel, the biofuel industry needs to overcome the supply chain barrier caused by temporal and spatial variability of biomass yield and quality. This study highlights the importance of incorporating spatial and temporal variability during biomass supply chain planning via optimization modeling that incorporates 10 years of drought index data, a primary factor contributing to yield and quality variability. The results imply that the cost of delivering biomass to biorefinery may be significantly underestimated if the multi-year temporal and spatial variation in biomass yield and quality is not captured.

	abstract = {The optimization of biomass supply chains is becoming increasingly important, especially for low-density biomass feedstocks that have limited market value and require efficient handling and logistics. This study addresses this issue by proposing an integrated approach to optimize biomass supply chain networks for energy production with the steam Rankine cycle. The approach takes into account the inherent variability of feedstock availability and energy market values, to ensure adaptability to fluctuating conditions. The biomass supply network is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, where the optimization objective is to maximize the economic viability of the system. The optimal configuration of the supply network includes the selection of biomass supply zones and storage facilities, the transportation links, and the optimization of the process variables within the conversion plants, taking into account the variable heat demand. The optimization approach is applied to a hypothetical case study of a relatively small region in Slovenia. The results show the economic viability of biomass utilization with a net present value of almost 300 MEUR, generating about 4 MW of electricity and 65 MW of heat. The uncertainties of the biomass supply, the fluctuations in product prices and the spatial scope of the case study are evaluated in addition. This analysis highlights and discusses the impact of these factors on the economic performance of the biomass supply chain network. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Biomass, as one of the most accessible renewable resources, could reduce dependency on fossil fuels and mitigate associated environmental impacts. With economic development and improved living standards, biomass in rural areas is converted into various forms of energy to meet high energy demands. However, existing studies on rural multi-energy system operations assume energy production from biomass is a given input parameter and consider it to be a fixed constant or subject to upper and lower bounds, independent of the biomass supply chain. Indeed, biomass energy production is significantly influenced by the collection, transportation, storage, and other processes within the supply chain. This work proposes a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the joint optimization of an integrated rural multi-biomass-solid waste energy conversion system with a source-grid-demand-based biomass-solid waste supply chain (IRMBS-BSC system). The IRMBS-BSC system encompasses three sub-systems: the biomass-solid waste source sub-system, the biomass-solid waste grid sub-system, and the biomass-solid waste demand sub-system. Various biomass-solid wastes are classified, and a source model is established to evaluate their availability. Subsequently, a supply chain model is developed within the biomass-solid waste grid sub-system. Based on the available and transported quantity from the biomass-solid waste source sub-system and grid sub-system, a multi-energy system operation model, considering refined biomass conversion processes, is proposed. A case study involving a multi-energy system that integrates multiple rural community biomass-solid waste supplies is conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed MILP, which considers the biomass-solid waste supply chain, can reduce energy imports during the load peak periods and can also decrease the overall operational costs of the multi-energy system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Malaysia generates substantial agricultural residues annually, endowing the country with significant biomass energy potential. Palm oil biomass stands out as a promising feedstock. However, its high humidity, bulkiness, low energy density, and dispersed resource locations (mills) pose challenges. A network that consisting collection facilities incorporating pretreatment operations as intermediaries between mills and biorefineries is a plausible solution. Nevertheless, the facility locations directly impact travel distance, overall expenses, and the nearby population. Moreover, vehicle routing during biomass collection influences transportation costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Consequently, this research designs a model to address the locationrouting intricacies within a two-echelon biomass supply chain. The model operates as a multiobjective optimization framework, encompassing three-dimensional sustainability assessment, quantified respectively as total cost minimization, CO2 emissions reduction, and minimization of the population affected. The research initially optimizes each objective function individually and subsequently advances to multi-objective optimization employing the weighted sum approach. While single-objective optimization yields optimal outcomes for each dimension, enhancements in one aspect may hinder performance in others. Nonetheless, the multi-objective optimization provides insight into the trade-offs among the sustainability objectives. The computational findings demonstrate the model could adapt the network configuration in alignment with distinct sustainability aspirations. © 2024, Universiti Putra Malaysia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The escalating depletion of hydrocarbon reserves and the escalating global climate crisis have catalyzed a significant shift towards biofuels as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the substantial cost disparity between biofuels and conventional fossil fuels presents a formidable obstacle to their widespread adoption. A pivotal component within the biofuel supply chain is the substantial financial burden associated with transporting biomass feedstocks to biorefineries for subsequent fuel production. For many low-cost or residue-based biomass feedstocks, the transportation cost represents a substantial portion of the total delivered price, often dominating the overall feedstock cost—especially when sourced from widely distributed or small-scale suppliers. Despite extensive scholarly inquiry, a comprehensive and accurate predictive model for biomass road transport costs remains elusive. This study endeavors to address this critical knowledge gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of global biomass road transport data to meticulously identify the key parameters that exert a significant influence on transportation costs. Through rigorous correlation analysis, fifteen independent variables were identified as having a discernible impact on the final transportation cost. Departing from the prevalent reliance on regression analysis in previous studies, this research demonstrates the limitations of multiple linear regression for accurately predicting transportation costs. Consequently, this study explores the predictive capabilities of two alternative machine learning algorithms: random forests and artificial neural networks. Comparative analysis unequivocally demonstrates the superior predictive performance of the random forest model, achieving a remarkable R-squared value of 97.4 % and a root mean square error of 165. Furthermore, this study delves into the relative importance of each independent variable in determining the overall transportation cost. In the multiple linear regression model, load factor and vehicle type emerged as the most influential factors, contributing 37 % and 31 % to the total cost variation, respectively. Conversely, the impact of distance on transportation costs was found to be minimal. In the more robust random forest model, vehicle type, distance, and load factor were identified as the most significant predictors, contributing 31 %, 25 %, and 12 % to the overall cost variation, respectively. The predictive model developed in this study offers valuable insights into the cost dynamics of biomass transportation. By facilitating precise predictions of transportation costs, stakeholders are empowered to streamline logistical operations, augment operational efficiency, and consequently, curtail overall biofuel production expenses. The resultant enhancement in the price competitiveness of biofuels relative to fossil fuels is poised to stimulate broader utilization of these renewable resources. Furthermore, the transportation sector, a primary consumer of fuel, stands to gain substantially, as the adoption of cost-effective, cleaner-burning fuels fosters a transition towards more sustainable logistics practices. © 2025 The Authors},

This paper focuses on biomass supply chains, where the waste has several utilisation possibilities, each with different quality requirements. The biomass has to be distributed among the recycling facilities, where it can be processed by different technologies, and finally, the products are transported to the customers. Due to the uncertainties in the recycling processes, the quality of the products become known only after processing the waste. Thus the basic challenge is to find a robust facility and technology selection plan, which performs well, even if some quality issues are expected.

	abstract = {The European Union has embarked on a European Green Deal programme that advocates for a transition from fossil fuels to sustainable production. Attempts are being made to identify biomass sources and bioproducts (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, or biofuels) that do not compete significantly with food production and have a low environmental impact. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the environmental impact of the supercritical CO2 extraction of poplar biomass in a life cycle assessment (LCA). The production system was examined in a cradle-to-gate approach. In the analysed system, poplar biomass was extracted, and residual biomass was converted to pellets which were used to generate process heat. The functional unit was 1 kg of packaged extract. The results showed that the step of biomass extraction using S-CO2 (in subsystem II) made the greatest contribution to all but two impact categories, with contribution from 25.3% to 93.8% for land use and global warming categories, respectively. In contrast, the whole subsystem I (biomass production and logistics) had a low environmental impact. Heat generation from residual biomass led to a minor decrease in the system’s environmental impact. Greenhouse gases emission reached 440 kg of CO2 equivalents per 1 kg of the extract, and they were associated with high electricity consumption and steam production. Despite the application of residual biomass for heat generation, the overall environmental impacts, especially in terms of human health and ecosystem damage, remain significant, indicating the need for further optimisation and mitigation strategies in the production process. Moreover, the share of renewables in the energy mix supplied to biorefineries should mitigate the environmental impact of the extraction process. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The biomass resource is very abundant in rural areas because of diverse agricultural activities, which enables the biogas to substitute the natural gas for the energy supply in where the natural gas network cannot extend. Thanks to the flexibility of biogas whose physical characteristic is similar to natural gas, it can not only power the biogas-based generators in the power distribution system but also meet the local biogas demand through a local biogas grid, finally formulating a distributed local biomass-based integrated energy system (IES). In such a system, proper anaerobic digestion (AD) plants planning is of great importance as the cost of transporting biomass feedstock is costly due to its high weight per unit of energy generated. Conventional AD plants planning is usually formulated as optimization problems of biomass supply chain whose focus is the planning of the transportation routes from biomass supply node to the AD plants, neglecting the downstream of the supply chain from the AD plants to the end-users. In this paper, a novel comprehensive optimization model formulated as a mixed-integer second-order-cone problem (MISOCP) is proposed to minimize the total investment and energy supply costs of the local biomass-based IES and to determine the networks of local biogas grid, to plan facilities, e.g., biogas-based generators and AD plants, and to optimize biomass transportation routes. with consideration of the network physical characteristics. Additionally, considering the anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) technology has better performance on biogas yield compared to anaerobic mono-digestion (AmoD), a strategy is developed to choose mono-digestion or co-digestion system for AD plants as well. This model is demonstrated with a real-world test system, and an environmental and economic assessment for evaluating the profitability of each AD plant is presented. The planning results showed that AcoD plant is most cost-competitive when the food waste and animal manure are locally-sufficient. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {When developing a biomass production plan, the factors that influence decision makers include not only the different parts of the biomass supply chain itself, but also the social, environmental and economic impacts of the biomass system and the degree of difficulty in developing it within a particular country. In order to take these factors into account, this paper proposes a two-tier generalised decision-making system (gBEDS) for biomass, with a database at its core, including basic biomass information and detailed decision-making information, in addition to a database of scenarios and a library of case studies that provide demonstrations for new users. On the basis of the database, the decision-making system includes a simulation module for the unit process (uP) and a genetic algorithm for optimising the decisions. With the help of a graphical interface, users can define their own biomass supply chain and evaluate it environmentally, economically, socially or otherwise; on the basis of a simulation and optimisation model of the whole life cycle of biomass production, the system uses data mining methods (fuzzy c-mean clustering and decision trees) to determine the optimal geographic location of the biomass raw material collection and storage and conversion plants. Madab was used to develop a computational model for biomass planning parameters (e.g. costs and c02 emissions) for the biomass supply chain. At the same time, a visual representation of the bioenergy conversion plant and storage data is made using Geographic Information Systems (GIs) to support users in making decisions based on intelligent outputs. Thus, gBEDS supports biomass national planners in developing an effective biomass production plan with comprehensive evaluation, and local designers and implementers in defining optimised, detailed unit processes to implement said plan. © 2024; Los autores.},

	abstract = {A multiproduct lignocellulosic biorefinery converts various types of biomass into value-added products or energy through different conversion pathways. However, its operation is susceptible to the changing nature of biomass properties, biomass feedstock supply, ambient temperature, and product demands. Therefore, a new optimal resource allocation scheme must be devised instantly upon detecting any fluctuations in the biorefinery to avoid oversupply or undersupply issues. Previous literature on biorefinery resource allocation uses a mainly nonlinear programming approach that assumes steady state for all parameters during simulation; this may result in a delay of response time due to the time taken during the optimization stage. In this paper, a resource allocation system based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed for the biorefinery. The input nodes of the DNN are the parameters that undergo fluctuations while the output nodes are the flowrate allocation of biomass to different chemical and energy conversion pathways. The connection weights and topology of the DNN are optimized using the neuro-differential evolution (NDE) algorithm. The optimization results of the DNN yields an average optimality of 97.7% and reduces the response time by 99.5% as compared to the conventional nonlinear solver. The proposed DNN-NDE framework accounts for both responsiveness and cost performance during the synthesis of a smart resource allocation system.

	abstract = {Optimizing municipal solid waste (MSW) management through the production of valuable products and energy conversion is crucial to mitigate environmental damage and promote economic sustainability. This study focuses on addressing the MSW supply chain problem by exploring the optimal location for the waste treatment. The supply chain network encompasses MSW transfer stations, treatment facilities, and markets with product demands. The methodological approach entails constructing a superstructure, gathering relevant data, and analyzing the results. Both deterministic MILP and two stage stochastic model are used in this study. A deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is employed to optimize the MSW supply chain problem, with the use of solver BARON. To account for uncertainties in supply–demand and transportation costs, a two-stage stochastic MILP model is developed. The deterministic equivalent approach is then employed to solve the stochastic model, resulting in an average solution across all scenarios. The decision variable pertaining to the selection of treatment technology locations is managed in the first stage. The second stage focuses on determining transportation and production-related decisions.

	abstract = {The escalating global warming crisis and the dwindling traditional energy sources have spurred an urgent need for exploring sustainable and renewable energy options. In this context, third-generation biodiesel has emerged as a promising and cleaner alternative for the transportation sector, gaining widespread attention due to its environmental and social benefits. However, ensuring the sustainable and efficient production and delivery of biodiesel to the market requires an optimal supply chain management strategy, encompassing a coordinated effort by all stakeholders involved. This paper presents a novel multi-objective decision support model for managing a multi-echelon third-generation biodiesel supply chain comprising a biomass producer, a biorefinery, and multiple retailers. The proposed model leverages a multi-objective non-linear optimization framework, incorporating economic and environmental objectives to achieve a balance between profitability and sustainability. The economic performance of the model is analyzed using an uncertain activity-based costing approach and a single-setup-multi-delivery policy, while carbon emissions are reduced at every stage of the supply chain to enhance environmental performance. To deal with the uncertainties in the decision-making parameters, a robust possibilistic programming-based solution methodology is employed, providing optimality and feasibility robustness to the obtained solutions. Furthermore, a weighted goal programming approach is adopted to achieve an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives of the model, and the NP-hard problem is solved using a metaheuristic approach. The practical applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated through an experimental study, and the performance of the numerical outcomes is analyzed under varying decision-maker preferences and sensitivity analysis. The experimental findings indicate that SSMD reduces the total cost of the system. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate the environmental, economic, and technological factors that can enhance supply chain management performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Increasing energy demand and the rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions have increased the necessity of bioenergy and sustainable energy generation. The sustainable bioenergy supply chain is the key to produce sustainable biofuel. This paper points to render an optimization model for planning a versatile and dependable biomass-to-bioenergy sustainable supply chain network in which crop residuals from several agricultural sectors, multi-transportation disruption modes, multi-biorefineries, multi-biogas plants, and multi-market centers are investigated for two bioenergy sources, namely biofuel and biogas. For this reason, supply chain cost optimization, emissions of feedstock transport, processing, and distributing end biofuel to respective markets are utilized. The multi-setup-multi-delivery (MSMD) concept is incorporated and lead time crashing cost is applied to minimize the lead time in this model. The carbon emission costs at all steps and the variable production rate for the production of bioenergy are included within the model. Finally, one small-scale data and another large-scale data of six agricultural areas, four biorefineries, four biogas plants, and six markets are considered to validate the model's usefulness. The model's goal is to show bioenergy's effect to make a sustainable supply chain of biofuel and biogas. The numerical results reveal that the cost of bioenergy production contributed 54.12%, a major extent of the whole cost in biorefinery and biogas plants. The transportation segment is the preeminent initiator of carbon emissions with 83.33% in the entire carbon emission within the whole supply chain. Although, transportation cost contributed 33.09% of the total cost, the multi setup-delivery-multi-delivery policy minimized the whole supply chain cost. The results provide a systematic guideline for developing a sustainable biofuel supply-chain by minimizing cost, various aspects of transportation logistics, and multi-model alternatives under reduced energy effects. © 2021},

	abstract = {Biomass is an abundant resource for energy production and it has gained attention as a mainstream option to meet increasing energy demands. Pyrolysis has been one of the most prevalent thermochemical processes for biomass conversion. In the pyrolysis process, the biomass decomposes into three byproducts: bio-oil (60–75%), biochar (15–25%), and syngas (10–20%), depending on the feedstock and its composition. The energy required to convert the biomass varies depending on the levels of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. This work proposes a novel two-stage stochastic model that designs an efficient biomass supply chain mindful of the trade-offs between pyrolysis byproducts (bioethanol and biochar). Remarkably, the model integrates biomass quality-related costs associated with moisture and ash content such as the energy consumption of preprocessing equipment and boiler maintenance due to excess ash. Biomass quality directly affects the production yield as well as the total cost of production and distribution. The results from our case study indicate a shortage of biomass from the suppliers to fulfill the demand for biochar from the power plants and bioethanol from the cities. Furthermore, the bioethanol price has the most impact on the total supply chain according to our sensitivity analysis. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this study, the instant catapult steam explosion (ICSE) was investigated as an alternative preprocessing method to treat corn stalk feedstocks, and compared with conventional milling preprocessing. Besides reducing the particle size, ICSE can modify the microstructure and improve enzymatic degradability of the corn stalks as well. These preprocessed feedstocks were further pretreated by moderate chemical pretreatment methods, including dilute acid, dilute alkali, acid and alkali, organosolv, and ionic liquid. The ICSE-treated feedstocks showed 3-fold to 7-fold increase in enzymatic saccharification when compared with milled and untreated feedstocks. Meanwhile, its energy consumption only accounted for 5%–20% of the milling process, thereby resulting in an 80%–85% of energy savings. Therefore, the ICSE-based preprocessing can potentially be integrated with the supply chain of lignocellulosic biomass and enhance the economic efficiency of biorefinery. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigates power pricing decisions in a resilient supply chain, including the main biomass supplier, biorefinery, the hybrid power plant, and the backup supplier. The power plant's main fuel is considered biofuel derived from Jatropha Curcas L. (JCL). However, due to unavoidable uncertainties in biofuel supply links, the shortage in meeting demand is inevitable. Therefore, for increasing the supply chain's resiliency, the fossil fuel backup supplier is taken into account to make up the shortage with anticipated fossil fuel. Due to environmental concerns, the penalty cost is considered for excessive use of fossil fuel. The model is studied under two cases by considering a dual-channel biorefining. Different game-theoretic models are established for varied power configurations and interactions of supply chain members. It is observed from the numerical study that, depending on the fractional part of the power plant's requirements of biofuel and JCL supplied by the biorefinery (Case 1) and the main supplier (Case 2), respectively the performance of the supply chain increases in the presence of the backup supplier. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that Case 1 is more profitable than Case 2 for chain members. Moreover, in contrast to the fossil fuel replacement coefficient, the greater the convertibility degree of the JCL, the larger the profits for the members. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The design and preliminary estimations of biomass supply chains are essential in matching energy supply to energy demand. This is especially true of novel/future fuels and technologies in large industries. In this paper, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model was formulated to represent biofuel supply chains across Europe for the production of three novel marine fuels and to allow the selection of fuel conversion technologies, biomass supply locations, and the logistics of transportation from resources to conversion and from conversion to final markets. On top of this, the total production costs and emissions were calculated and compared to current marine fuels to assess the implementation potential and feasibility of these fuels. The MILP model was used to design and analyze optimal distribution and conversion systems, using a realistic data-set covering the European member states and 15 of the largest bunkering ports in the EU. The results showed that on average, the fuels obtained a 72% greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction compared to a fossil fuel comparator and ranged from 22–36 €/GJ in total production costs. It was also discovered that forestry residues were the best-suited biomass for the production of these fuels and that Poland had the highest supply potential of all considered states. The available supply of biomass was sufficient for the demand in the foreseeable future, the largest impediment to the adoption of these fuels is the available refining potential in Europe.

One of the most viable alternatives to fossil fuels is bioenergy, particularly biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of renewable feedstocks. The revised Renewable Energy Directive (D 2018/2001) recognizes that biogas production from agricultural residues, livestock production, and industrial by-products is an acknowledged greenhouse gas mitigation technology in cases where their use results in a certain level of specific greenhouse gas savings. This study delivered values for the maximum transport distance of agricultural residues and industrial by-products to achieve the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-saving requirement defined by Directive 2018/2001. It analysed the greenhouse gas emissions reduction for numerous feedstocks for which Directive 2018/2001 has not defined the default and typical values but which could be used as sustainable substitutes for currently dominantly used maize silage in biogas production. The results obtained in this work define the maximum transport and distribution distance for which biogas produced from considered feedstocks achieved required specific greenhouse gas emissions savings (80%), compared with fossil fuel comparator.

	abstract = {Developing integrated bioenergy systems (IBS) is important for achieving a sustainable energy source, maximizing biomass waste, and reducing a country’s heavy reliance on imported fuels. IBS are implemented via integrated biorefineries (i.e., plant level) or bioenergy parks (i.e., industrial park level). Both systems are already proven to operate efficiently by utilizing possible synergies between process units or component plants through material and energy integration. However, the drawback of interconnected systems is the ripple and amplification effect of disruption when one component experiences failure. For IBS, capacity disruptions can result from biomass feedstock supply chain bottlenecks or internal process inoperability. These disruption scenarios can cause partial system inoperability or even network failure. In this work, a risk analysis and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) based framework to assess and determine the reliability of IBS against variable capacity disruptions was developed. The MCS method is known to determine failure rates by introducing a probabilistic input to a model. Two case studies are considered in this work to illustrate the applicability of the model to a range of IBS networks. Results show that the proposed method is able to determine capacity and stream reliability against multiple disruption scenarios. This work contributes to designing and implementing robust IBS networks at any scale. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Hence, the increasing global interest in contributing to the biofuel supply chain (BSC), from biomass feedstock to biofuel production, has led to a huge amount of scientific production in recent years. In this vein, techno-economic analysis (TEA) of biofuel production to estimate total costs and revenues is highly important for transitioning towards a bioeconomy. This research aims to provide a comprehensive image of the body of knowledge in TEA evolution within the BSC domain. To this end, a systematic science mapping analysis, supported by a bibliometric analysis, is carried out on 1104 articles from 1986 to 2021. As a result, performance indicators of the scientific production within the target literature are presented to explain how this literature has evolved. Besides, thematic trends and conceptual structures of TEA of biofuel production are discovered. The results show that (i) biofuel production and consumption need promotion through tax measures and price subsidies, (ii) the development of cost-competitive algal biofuels has faced many challenges over recent years, and (iii) TEA of algal biofuels to identify commercial improvements and increase the economic feasibility is still lacking, which calls for more in-depth investigations. Consequently, current challenges and future perspectives of TEA in the BSC domain are rendered. The provided insights enable researchers and decision-makers involved in BSCs to (i) capture the most influential contributors to the field and (ii) identify major research hotspots and potential directions for further development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Pine needles (pine tree leaves), found abundantly across continents such as North America, Asia, Europe, South America, Africa, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, are a significant global concern due to their high susceptibility to catching fire, especially in dry and hot climates. The same issue persists in the Uttarakhand state of India, which boasts ample pine forests, yielding a substantial 1.67 × 109 kg of pine needles annually. In the present study, the annual potential emissions from forest fires in Uttarakhand were estimated to be 58.37 × 109 kg of CO2 equivalent. Therefore, the present research aims to unlock pine needles’ potential via gasification for green electricity and biochar production, offering an alternative to coal-based plants while reducing forest fire frequencies. Nevertheless, obstacles hindering pine needle gasification include an unsteady supply chain, limited collection windows (100 days), and plant expenses, including transportation and operational costs. The primary focus of the research is to design and assess the performance of a gasification-based supply chain for pine needles in the Almora District of Uttarakhand. Ten plant capacity scenarios were considered, ranging from 25 to 250 kW. The study incorporated critical factors, encompassing diverse losses within the supply chain, selecting potential plant sites, minimizing transportation distance, and evaluating the supply chain’s economic and environmental performance. The economic analysis revealed that the 250-kW plant scenario exhibited a minimum discounted payback period (DPP) of 3.93 years, alongside an internal rate of return (IRR) of 19% and a net present value (NPV) of 653.32 million INR without government subsidies. With subsidies included, the DPP decreased to 1.30 years, improving the IRR to 69% with an NPV of 916.17 million INR. The emission analysis indicated that gasification plant capacity scenarios could potentially reduce 44.63 × 106 to 46.16 × 106 kg of CO2 equivalent emissions annually compared to grid electricity while meeting nearly 5.5% of the electricity demand of Almora district. The present study aligns with SDG-7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG-13 (Climate Action), SDG-9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG-11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG-3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG-15 (Life on Land).

	abstract = {Biomass ash is a byproduct of renewable energy generation that can be used in the cement and concrete industries as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) to reduce their environmental impact. However, using biomass ashes as an SCM presents challenges, such as the distant location of crops and processing plants from cement and concrete plants, the absence of a supply chain to connect the biomass ash and cement/concrete producers, and the lack of a mechanism to set the price of the ash. We adopted a supply chain perspective to evaluate the environmental and economic impact of incorporating biomass ashes as an SCM in the cement and concrete industries. We developed a bilevel optimization model considering the strategic behavior of the two stakeholders of the supply chain: the biomass ash generator, which maximizes its profits by setting the price of the ash, and the cement/concrete manufacturer and minimizes its total operating costs, including the processes necessary to adapt its supply chain for the use of new raw material. We validated the model using data from the Colombian context at a nationwide industrial level. Our results indicate that introducing SCMs can potentially reduce CO2 emissions without increasing the cost of the supply chain. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biomass feedstock is a key sustainable alternative to the finite fossil resources to produce fuels and chemicals. Biomass sources vary from energy crops to a wide range of municipal, agricultural, and industrial wastes. Therefore, it is attracting growing attention due to its wide availability in almost every country worldwide. However, due to the irregular generation and the scattered distribution of biomass resources, the design of supply chains and the selection of refinery sites become a challenging task. As such, this study presents a framework for an optimal site selection of a multiple biomass refinery. Qatar is chosen as the case study, whereby, its main sources and locations of biomass are identified. While a mathematical optimisation model is established by utilising the geographic information system (GIS) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to spot optimal biorefinery sites that may enhance the supply chain of available biomass. Multiple criteria are considered in the model including the site accessibility to key infrastructural facilities, as well as biomass locations, availability, and calorific values. While several constraints are employed to alleviate social and environmental concerns. The model generates several candidate sites, which are then reduced to a single optimal site (at coordinates: 25.144, 51.351). The selected optimal site is believed to maximise the potential biomass energy supply and enhance the biomass supply chain through minimising biomass transportation cost, which is evaluated at an average of 7 $/tonne.

The role of biomass recycling logistics in the sustainable development of biomass resources and power generation endeavors has grown increasingly significant. To realize environmentally friendly and economical straw logistics, it is imperative to establish an efficient, economic and sustainable straw recycling logistics network. Therefore, based on the weighting theory and top-down method, this study proposes a planning model aiming at minimum total cost and minimum carbon emission to locate the logistics network. The immune algorithm is applied to solve and analyze the proposed examples. It is concluded that under the condition that the total cost is reasonable, reducing transportation cost.

	abstract = {The biomass energy sector in most developing countries is not well established due to the high cost of implementation and lack of quantitative planning tools. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a quantitative planning tool used to plan and optimise biomass supply chains based on carbon reduction targets. The tool proposed in this work centres on three important stages: Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA), mathematical optimisation, and multi-stakeholder analysis. CEPA is used to determine the minimum amount of biomass to achieve carbon reductions. Then, mathematical optimisation is used to optimise the biomass supply chain based on the carbon reduction target. The optimisation step considers the use of new biomass power plants and co-firing existing power plants. Following this, the importance of power plants within the optimal biomass supply chain is identified using a multi-stakeholder analysis method known as Shapley-Shubik power index. Shapley-Shubik power index is used to determine the level of power held by each power plant in the biomass supply chain based on the number of times each stakeholder become pivotal in achieving several quotas (i.e., power purchase agreement). A case study comprising a biomass supply chain in Malaysia is solved to demonstrate the presented tool. The case study analyses several scenarios in which the biomass supply chain can be deployed. Case study results indicated that co-firing existing power plants did indeed minimise capital and operating expenditure. Conversely, the cost of transporting biomass may be high depending on the location of these plants. Boiler systems were the most chosen due to their high biomass-to-power conversion rates. The multi-stakeholder analysis determined that a power plant with higher power output, cheaper costs, and superior biomass-to-power conversion rate often appears as the more significant player in the supply chain. © 2021},

	abstract = {A feasible alternative to the production of fossil fuels is the production of biofuels. In order to minimize the costs of producing biofuels, we developed a stochastic programming formulation that optimizes the inbound delivery of biomass. The proposed model captures the variability in the moisture and ash content in the biomass, which define its quality and affect the cost of biofuel. We propose a novel hub-and-spoke network to take advantage of the economies of scale in transportation and to minimize the effect of poor quality. The first-stage variables are the potential locations of depots and biorefineries, and the necessary unit trains to transport the biomass. The second-stage variables are the flow of biomass between the network nodes and the third-party bioethanol supply. A case study from Texas is presented. The numerical results show that the biomass quality changes the selected depot/biorefinery locations and conversion technology in the optimal network design. The cost due to poor biomass quality accounts for approximately 8.31% of the investment and operational cost.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a change of approach in the field of using renewable energy and transitioning from fossil energy. Among its reasons, we can mention climate changes and global warming, population growth and increasing demand for energy, the limitation of fossil resources and their price increase, and issues such as energy security. Renewable energy has different types such as solar energy, biofuel energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, etc. Reports show that most of the pollution is related to the transportation sector. Since bioenergy can be used for heat, electricity, and fuel purposes, some countries use it as an alternative or hybrid fuel. Using biofuels has economic, social, and environmental advantages and helps sustainable development. In the current research, the interaction between the farmer, the biorefinery, and the government has been investigated under six scenarios. The farmer determines the amount of land allocated to second-generation biomass cultivation. Biorefinery specifies the technology level and process of biofuel production. Since biofuel production processes are regularly being investigated in laboratories and have a growing trend, The concept of technology level is also considered to examine different states of low-level technology to high-level technology. In some scenarios, the government adopts a policy of indifference, and in some scenarios an active support policy by providing subsidies. At the end, a numerical example is presented numerical sensitivity analysis is performed, and management results are expressed. The results show that the input rate of biomass to the biorefinery is effective in adopting the technology level. Also, the highest price of biomass exists in the case where the farmer decides to develop the land with a non-linear cost because the costs increase. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study began with an analysis of the state of the art, firstly carrying out a systematic review of the literature, accompanied by a benchmarking that led to a consolidation of the concept in a first phase, which was then followed by the construction of a prototype using the Figma tool. Thus, this study resulted in a disruptive tool that could optimize the information flow between the stakeholders, and that could result in benefits for all of them. The study presents some insights that can be used in the success of future projects in this field. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Life cycle optimization (LCO) is an effective decision-making method combining life cycle assessment and optimization, which is capable of adjusting system configurations to meet specified sustainability goals. This study analyzed the status quo of LCO studies related to sustainable waste management and the circular economy. Most studies have focused on simultaneously optimizing environmental and economic objectives, whereas few have considered social impacts. Greenhouse gas emissions is the most commonly used environmental indicator in optimization, followed by the endpoint single-score indicator. A static deterministic model is often employed to formulate an LCO problem, while uncertainty and dynamic models are less frequently applied but cause concerns. To deal with multi-objective optimization, the ε-constraint method and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm are popular. Waste LCO has been mainly applied to macro system planning, such as integrated municipal solid waste management systems, biowaste supply chains, waste-to-energy systems, and waste-to-resource networks, aiming to determine optimal waste allocation, facility capacity/location, technology choice, etc. It is occasionally used in optimizing process structure, operating conditions, blending ratio of feedstocks, and product development. Future research should focus on exploring the integration of more environmental and social indicators into multi-objective optimization, modeling under uncertainty, dynamic LCO, process and product optimization, and addressing the lack of multi-scale studies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW) has a high potential for energy and value-added product recovery due to its carbon- and nutrient-rich composition; however, traditional value chains have treated OFMSW as an undesired by-product. This study focuses on value chain optimisation to assist the transition to resource recovery value chains. To achieve this, this work combined two stage stochastic mathematical optimisation with geographical spatial analysis and time series waste generation analysis. Existing infrastructure in England, including anaerobic digestion plants and road transportation networks, were included in the model. To account for uncertainty in waste generation, multiple scenarios and their associated probabilities were developed based on environmental variables. The optimisation problem was solved to further advance the understanding of economically optimal waste-to-resource value chains under waste generation variability. The pertinent decision variables included sizing, technology selection, waste flows and location of thermochemical treatment sites. The model highlights the potential reduction in system profitability as a result of different operating constraints, such as minimum plant operating capacity factors and landfill taxation. The latter was shown to have the largest impact on profitability as overconservative systems designs were implemented to hedge against the waste variability. Such computer-aided models offer opportunities to overcome the challenges posed by waste generation variability and waste to resource value chain transformation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Due to the growing demand for energy and environmental issues related to using fossil fuels, it is becoming tremendously important to find alternative energy sources. Bioethanol produced from switchgrass is considered as one of the best alternatives to fossil fuels. Methods: This study develops a two-stage supply chain modeling approach that first determines feasible locations for constructing switchgrass-based biorefineries in the state of North Dakota by using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis. In the second stage, the profit of the corresponding switchgrass-based bioethanol supply chain is maximized by developing a mixed-integer linear program that aims to commercialize the bioethanol production while impacts of energy use and carbon emission costs on the supply chain decisions and siting of biorefineries are included. Results: The numerical results show that carbon emissions and energy consumption penalties affect optimal biorefinery selections and supply chain decisions. Conclusions: We conclude that there is no need to penalize both emissions and energy use simultaneously to achieve desirable environmental benefits, otherwise, the supply chain becomes non-profitable. Moreover, imposing emissions or energy consumption penalties makes the optimization model closer to supply sources while having higher land rental costs. Such policies would promote sustainable second-generation biomass production, thus decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The growing concern for environmental sustainability and limited resources in recent years has stimulated innovative strategies for efficient waste management and sustainable resource utilization. A novel approach in this context involves replacing single-cell proteins based on residues, aiming to reduce reliance on animal protein. The paper has suggested a novel multi-level, multi-period, multi-product mixed-integer linear programming model to design an efficient single-cell protein supply chain network through recycling municipal solid waste and sewage. Seven recycling technologies are considered, and their capacities are optimized. The network investigation involves identifying the location and capacity of centers at each supply chain level, the production technology type used at these centers, and other logistics network management decisions like inventory level and material flow throughout network. The proposed model has been applied in a real case in Iran for a 20-year planning horizon. The production of additional by-products, including electricity, heat, and bio-fertilizer, is also studied. An extensive sensitivity analysis of key parameters, including demand, production center capacities, and costs related to feedstock and final product processing, is conducted. The research revealed that rail transportation was favored by 62% of respondents over road transportation. Furthermore, the study identified the medium capacity level as the most suitable, considering the high production volume, which constituted about 60% of the total output. The evaluation results emphasize the model's efficiency and performance, highlighting its potential to improve and optimize the single-cell proteins supply chain network. © 2025},

	abstract = {Fungal laccases catalyze a wide range of reactions that have fostered an escalating demand in diverse sectors. Higher productivity in a short period remains a major challenge that needs to be fulfilled for successful industrial applications. In the present study, statistical optimization methods were utilized for high-yielding laccase production by the fungusTrametes maximaIIPLC-32 that achieved 103 IU mL−1activity and a 13.3-fold increase compared to that under unoptimized conditions. Optimization using the Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and Box-Behnken design (BBD) identified that glucose, xylidine, veratryl alcohol, CuSO4, and potassium phosphate significantly influenced the laccase production. Furthermore, it also revealed that glucose contributed maximally to the overall laccase production, followed by xylidine and veratryl alcohol. Mathematical models were used for kinetic analysis. Kinetics of biomass formation followed the logistic growth model (with the model parameter values ofXmax= 9.54 g L−1,μmax= 0.77 d−1, andR2= 0.95). Laccase production kinetics followed the Luedeking-Piret model (with the model parameters ofα= 0.12 IU mg−1,β= 1.57 IU mg−1d−1, andR2= 0.90), indicating that the laccase produced byTrametes maximaIIPLC-32 is partially growth associated. The logistic mass balance equation adequately described substrate utilization. The model parameters ofYx/s= 0.96 g g−1andm= 0.05 g g−1d−1were retrieved from the logistic mass balance equation. The applicability of the enzyme produced from the optimized process was checked for the decolorization of remazol brilliant blue R, and the maximum decolorization efficiency of 92.3% was achieved within 8 h of reaction without the addition of a mediator. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.},

	abstract = {The valorisation of biomass by synthesising a multi-biomass corridor can be an optimistic pathway to solving the growing waste management problem. However, the supply chain problem usually involves a massive number of variables, including the connectivity of the sink source and the selection of a technology pathway. In this work, a “Decomposition Approach” was utilised, wherein a P-graph was incorporated with a conventional mathematical model to reduce the number of variables. Although this type of approach is well established with respect to solving biomass supply chain problems, no previous works have comprehensively considered the effect of the maximum allowable travel distance (MATD) on a supply chain model. A case study in Peninsular Malaysia involving oil palm, paddy, and coconut biomass was conducted using the proposed approach. Moreover, a multiple linear regression (MLR) tool for formulating the cost-correlated function based on the best technology pathway obtained from a P-Graph was incorporated. As a result, the net profit of the biomass corridor was estimated to be USD 0.87 billion, with 1.45 × 107 tonnes per year of biomass being sent to 39 processing hubs over a 20-year lifespan. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was also conducted to investigate the impact of several cost-related parameters on the net profit. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising solution to cope with the large amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in densely populated metropolitan areas of developing countries. But technical and logistical limitations typically necessitate optimal plant locations and a strong supply chain for MSW-based HTC plants to be economically attractive. To that end, a novel linear programming (LP)-based spatial optimization model has been developed that takes multiple critical constraints (biomass availability, hydrochar yield, market demand, costs of transporting and handling biomass and hydrochar, and land cost) into account to maximize the net profit of HTC plants. Dhaka, being a mega city, is burdened with the issue regarding disposal of large quantity of MSW. A case study was conducted based on the MSW management system of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) for two schemes, a single (79.26 MWthermal) plant and a double (39.63 MWthermal) plant, in Dhaka city and its surrounding area. The model showed that the single plant scheme generated a higher profit (~18.5 million USD) than the double plant scheme (~17.7 million USD). Locations within Dhaka city near the secondary transfer stations were found to be favorable for plant establishment in both schemes. Further analysis revealed that plants' net profit is highly dependent on their optimal locations, with total transportation cost being the most significant location-sensitive element. Standardized coefficients suggest that for a single plant scheme, total transportation cost will always have a more dominant effect than land cost. This model will be able to guide the policy makers to take necessary steps for proper management of ever-growing city waste by setting up HTC facilities at optimal locations. © 2023 International Energy Initiative},

	abstract = {Sustainable bioenergy production is essential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The logistics of managing dispersed and low-value biomass from forestry, agricultural, and municipal solid waste value chains pose significant challenges, including high transportation costs, seasonal availability, and storage limitations. This systematic literature review examines the critical operations, including collection, transportation, and preprocessing, necessary to optimize bioenergy supply chains. A central contribution of this paper is an analysis of integrating biomass value chains through collaborative models that leverage shared infrastructure and adaptive logistics to enhance cost efficiency and resource utilization. It also identifies critical gaps in optimization models, particularly the lack of comprehensive multi-biomass value chain integration frameworks and limited consideration of uncertainties in logistics planning. The analysis highlights that while mixed integer linear programming models dominate, they often overlook cross-chain synergies and logistics. By examining 112 articles, we show that integrating forestry, agricultural, and municipal solid waste value chains through shared infrastructure and collaborative planning can significantly reduce transportation costs, enhance supply stability, and improve resource utilization in bioenergy systems. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The design of biofuel value chains is a complex process due to the large number of stakeholders involved, seasonality in feedstock availability, security of supply, logistics costs, efficiency considerations, and its multi-node nature. Decisions on designing phytoremediation-to-biofuel value chains are even more complicated, due to the involvement of additional stakeholders, contamination impacting the types of biomass that can be grown and its yield, sparse land availability or small land plots – leading to lack of efficiency and economies of scale – and higher technology costs due to the need for contaminant separation. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) that supports biofuel value chains design when the biomass originates from the phytoremediation of contaminated land. It integrates various tools, including geographic information system (GIS) data input, machine learning for biomass suitability assessment, supply chain optimization, evaluation of economic, environmental, and social key performance indicators, and a multicriteria method for ranking scenarios (i.e. combinations of biomass types and conversion technologies). The aim is to assist various types of stakeholders to assess the feasibility of establishing a phytoremediation-to-biofuel value chain, to decontaminate land, and to produce clean biofuels, while simultaneously considering multiple environmental, social, and economic criteria. A case-study application in Greece is also presented and the findings are discussed. The web-based DSS tool has several novel aspects, such as its ability to allow end-to-end value-chain assessment, the adoption of novel machine learning methods to predict biomass species performance on contaminated land and to allow consideration of mobile pyrolysis conversion units together with fixed conversion units. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The transition to a sustainable bio-based economy is perceived as a valid path towards low-carbon development for emerging economies that have rich biomass resources. In the case of Colombia, the role of biomass has been tackled through qualitative roadmaps and regional climate policy assessments. However, neither of these approaches has addressed the complexity of the bio-based economy systematically in the wider context of emission mitigation and energy and chemicals supply. In response to this limitation, we extended a bottom-up energy system optimization model by adding a comprehensive database of novel bio-based value chains. We included advanced road and aviation biofuels, (bio)chemicals, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and integrated biorefinery configurations. A scenario analysis was conducted for the period 2015–2050, which reflected uncertainties in the capacity for technological learning, climate policy ambitions, and land availability for energy crops. Our results indicate that biomass can play an important, even if variable, role in supplying 315–760 PJ/y of modern bio-based products. In pursuit of a deep decarbonization trajectory, the large-scale mobilization of biomass resources can reduce the cost of the energy system by up to 11 billion $/year, the marginal abatement cost by 62%, and the potential reliance on imports of oil and chemicals in the future. The mitigation potential of BECCS can reach 24–29% of the cumulative avoided emissions between 2015 and 2050. The proposed system analysis framework can provide detailed quantitative information on the role of biomass in low carbon development of emerging economies. © 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The optimal design of a biomass supply chain is a complex problem, which must take into account multiple interrelated factors (i.e the spatial distribution of the network nodes, the efficient planning of logistics activities, etc.). Mixed Integer Linear Programming has proven to be an effective mathematical tool for the optimization of the design and the management strategy of Advanced Biofuel Supply Chains (ABSC). This work presents a MILP formulation of the economical optimization of ABSC design, comprising the definition of the associated weekly management plan. A general modeling approach is proposed with a network structure comprising two intermediate echelons (storage and conversion facilities) and accounts for train and truck freight transport. The model is declined for the case of a multi-feedstock ABSC for green methanol production tested on the Italian case study. Residual biomass feedstocks considered are woodchips from primary forestry residues, grape pomace, and exhausted olive pomace. The calculated cost of methanol is equal to 418.7 €/t with conversion facility cost accounting for 50% of the fuel cost share while transportation and storage costs for around 15%. When considering only woodchips the price of methanol increases to 433.4 €/t outlining the advantages of multi-feedstock approach. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address a biomass feedstock logistics problem to supply biomass from production fields to satellite storage locations (SSLs) and from there to bioenergy plants (BePs) and then to a biorefinery. It entails a new problem feature of routing load-out equipment sets among the SSLs to perform loading/unloading of biomass and/or its pre-processing operations. The ownership of the loading equipment is a very capital-intensive link of the ethanol production supply chain, which when loaded onto trucks and routed along the logistics chain significantly brings down the ethanol production costs. This will make ethanol a cost-competitive alternative to fossil fuels, lead to sustainable use of fossil fuels and add to the overall relevance of the bioenergy sector. In this regard, the objective of our problem is to minimize the total cost incurred due to the ownership of equipment sets, fixed setups, and land rental cost, as well as the cost of transporting biomass from the fields to the BePs and biocrude oil from the BePs to the refinery. A mixed-integer mathematical model of the problem is presented, and a nested Benders decomposition-based solution approach is developed which involves decomposing this large problem into three stages. Stage 1 deals with the selection of fields, BePs, and SSLs, and assignment of fields to the SSLs. The remaining model consists of multiple Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs) that are separable over individual BePs. For each BeP, the CVRP is further decomposed into Stage 2 and Stage 3 sub-problems where the Stage 2 problem is an allocation problem that assigns SSLs to tours associated to each BeP, and the Stage 3 problem is a variant of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that determines the sequence in which equipment is routed over the predesignated set of SSLs for each tour. These sub-problems are integer programs rather than linear programs. First novelty of our proposed approach is to effectively handle the integrality of variables arising due to the consideration of the routing of load-out equipment. Second is solution methodology and in the use of proposed multi-cut version of optimality cuts that capture the solution value at an integer solution for the sub-problems. These cuts aid in faster convergence and are shown to be stronger than those proposed in the literature. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a real-life problem that utilizes available GIS data for the catchment area of regions around Gretna and Bedford in Virginia. We then solved a set of varying problem size instances using the state-of-the-art CPLEX® Branch-and-Bound and Benders Strategy methods. The CPLEX® algorithms struggled to solve instances even 10 times smaller than the real-life problem size instances; with MIP optimality gaps ranging from 5.85% to 82.79% in the allowed time limit of 10,000 s. On the other hand, our proposed nested Benders decomposition algorithm was able to achieve faster convergence and provided optimal solutions for all the considered problem instances with an average CPU run-time of around 3,700 s. This validates the efficacy and superiority of our solution approach. Lastly, we summarize our work and point out some interesting potential future research opportunities. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in continuous base-load low-carbon renewable energy generation in the United States. Several technologies have been developed to convert biomass into energy, and anaerobic digestion is one such technology to convert food waste and animal manure into power by biochemical conversion and combustion. Many studies have looked at the optimization of the biomass supply chains in combination with environmental impacts. However, there are very few studies in the literature for determining the optimum location of biopower plants fed by food waste and manure. This study evaluates the optimum locations, sizes, and the number of plants for biopower production in Wisconsin using both mixed-integer linear programing and geographic information system network analysis (ArcGIS V10). The main objective of the study is to maximize the profits of biopower facilities accounting for both the profits from the biopower supply chain and carbon credits. In this study, two scenarios (base case and a future case) were evaluated by varying the carbon credits and the food waste tipping fee: the base case with $0 carbon credits and $0 food waste tipping fee and the future case with $15/ton CO2 savings and $40 tipping fee/ton collected for the food waste. The key results showed that the inclusion of a carbon credit and tipping fee policies increased the profitability of biopower production and predicted an increase in biopower production capacity from 15 to over 77 MW in WI, representing 1% of its annual electricity consumption.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A supply chain model for an economic and environmental assessment of pelleted and baled corn stover was developed based on minimizing the total cost of the supply system with the optimum location and capacity of each biomass processing facility. The model was applied on a county-level basis in the state of North Dakota, USA. Two different biomass availability scenarios were considered where either 35% or 50% of biomass (corn stover) was available for collection from farms and processing at the biorefinery. All the ethanol produced was assumed to be sold. Pelleted biomass system requires a pelleting step either at a collection facility or at the biorefinery itself, while baled biomass is ground at the biorefinery. The economic analysis of the alternate supply systems showed that using pelleted biomass reduces overall supply chain cost and minimum ethanol selling price by almost 12% compared to baled biomass system. The largest costs were associated with biorefinery processing while transportation had a relatively minor contribution to the total cost. Similarly, the environmental greenhouse gas emissions were also lower for the pelleted biomass supply system compared to baled biomass system. The 35% case scenario (near term) and 50% case scenario (future term) showed similar economic and environmental greenhouse gas emissions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

	abstract = {An integrated biorefinery (IBR) is a multi-process facility that uses agricultural waste to produce valuable bioenergy products. Several studies already have shown the potential economic, environmental, and social benefits of setting up IBRs. However, planning is crucial in the development of IBRs since several stakeholders are involved in its operation and the entire biomass-bioenergy supply chain. As an initial step, it is essential to identify the potential barriers to implementing IBRs at the local level prior to its nationwide scale-up. In this preliminary work, a Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) framework was used in analyzing barriers to implementing IBRs on a municipality level. DEMATEL-based methods determine the relation between cause-effect factors in a given problem. Based on the results, the primary causal barrier is the "Lack of potential feedstocks due to climate change and other factors (B6)" and the “Lack of technology and infrastructure readiness (B1)” is the highly-correlated barrier. The results from this preliminary study can be used to develop a more robust assessment of establishing IBRs. Farmers, investors, local government units, and policymakers can then use such analysis to create mechanisms to address the barriers and formulate policies in developing IBRs.

An optimization analysis of potential plant locations identified Santa Marta as the optimal choice, resulting in annual cost savings of USD 100,000 compared to other sites.

Defining the future location and supply logistics of conversion plants is imperative to ultimately transform the nation's renewable biomass resources into cost-competitive, high-performance feedstock for production of biofuels and bioproducts.

Conventional feedstock supply systems will be unable to handle cellulosic biomass nationwide, making it essential to expand the industry with an advanced feedstock supply system incorporating a distributed network of preprocessing depots and conversion plants, or biorefineries. Current studies are mostly limited to designing supply systems for specific regions of the country. We developed a national database with potential locations for depots and biorefineries to meet the nation's target demand of cellulosic biofuel. Blended feedstock with switchgrass and corn stover (harvested by either a two- or three-pass method) are considered in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model to deliver on-spec biomass that considers both, a desired quantity and quality at the biorefinery. The model solves for a network of varying size depots that supply to biorefineries of 725,000 dry tons/year. A total delivered feedstock cost that is less than $79.07/dry tons (2016$) is evaluated for years 2022, 2030, and 2040. In 2022, 124 depots and 59 biorefineries could be supplied with 42.8 million dt of corn stover and switchgrass. In 2030 and 2040, the total accessible biomass could increase to 215% and 393% respectively when compared to 2022. However, an $8/dry tons reduction in targeted delivery cost could reduce total accessible biomass by 67%. Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Texas were identified as potential states with a strong biofuel economy given that they had six or more biorefineries located in all scenarios. In some scenarios, Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Minnesota, Mississippi and South Carolina would greatly benefit from a depot network as these could only deliver to a biorefinery in a nearby state. To elaborate the impact of a nationwide consideration, the findings were compared with existing literature for different US regions. We also present results for biorefinery capacities that are double, triple and quadruple in size. © 2021},

	abstract = {In this study, a multi-period model of an organic waste-to-biodiesel phased supply chain network is developed to strategically consider variations in the biodiesel demand and the organic waste usage over a long-term planning interval. The proposed model can facilitate planning to determine the biorefinery location and the amount of biodiesel to produce, transport, or utilize to reduce the total cost of the organic waste-to-biodiesel supply chain network design while meeting the biodiesel demand during each period of the planning interval. The features and capabilities of the model are validated by application of a future organic waste-to-biodiesel supply chain network design in South Korea. The optimization results illustrate that the average total annual cost of the organic waste of biodiesel based on the multi-period model will be $US 4.2 billion per year during the period 2020–2030. The minimum selling prices for the optimal network design were determined ranged from $US 3.154–3.156/gallon of biodiesel containing 3% butanol derived from organic waste combined with diesel. A small portion (4.9–6.6%) of the total biodiesel demand was produced from organic waste because of low organic waste availability in the existing anaerobic digestion facilities, leading to increasing the outsourcing costs of butanol. The proposed approach will facilitate the strategic development of a sustainable supply chain network for organic waste recycling for material and energy valorization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We propose a model which identifies the right mix of biomass to optimize the performance of the thermochemical conversion process at the minimum cost. This is a chance-constraint programming (CCP) model which takes into account the stochastic nature of biomass quality. The proposed CCP model ensures that process requirements, which are impacted by physical and chemical properties of biomass, are met most of the time. We consider two problem settings, a centralized and a decentralized supply chain. We propose a mixed-integer linear program to model the blending problem in the centralized setting and a bilevel program to model the blending problem in the decentralized setting. We use the sample average approximation method to approximate the chance constraints, and propose solution algorithms to solve this approximation. We develop a case study for South Carolina using data provided by the Billion Ton Study. Based on our results, the blends identified consist mainly of pine and softwood residues. The blends identified and the suppliers selected by both models are different. The cost of the centralized supply chain is 2%–6% lower. The implications of these results are twofold. First, these results could lead to improved collaborations in the supply chain. Second, these results provide an estimate of the approximation error from assuming centralized decision making in the supply chain. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Case studies investigated include planning of Iow-ILUC biomass feedstock production, biomethane production using low-ILUC biomass feedstocks, integrated production of first generation (1G) and second generation (2G) bioethanol using Miscanthus, and production of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) using castor seeds. Analysis of results show that farmers interested in these models are recommended to sell low-ILUC biomass such as soybean, wheat and brassica above the breakeven price to avoid losses. The estimated selling price for the three crops are 362 €/t, 321 €/t and 381 €/t respectively. To meet the demand of 40,000 t/yr of 2G bioethanol in the UK, approximately 17,094 ha of underutilised land is required.

The source separation process reduces waste separation costs and improves the quality of recycled products by preventing the generation of mixed waste and assisting the waste recycling process. The purpose of this paper is to present a multi-period, multi-objective model for designing an integrated and sustainable supply chain network for municipal solid waste management that considers source separation and employs a reward-penalty mechanism. The objective functions include minimizing the system's total cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and adverse environmental impacts on residential areas. The proposed model is illustrated through a case study in Kermanshah, Iran. Three scenarios including the optimal solution of the proposed model considering the landfill location as a decision variable, the optimal solution of the proposed model with the current landfill location fixed, and the existing waste management system are introduced and compared. The results indicate that when the proposed system is used instead of the previous two scenarios, waste management costs are reduced by 12.4% and 66.6%, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 0.5%, and increased by 3.3%. Environmental impacts are increased by 16.5% and reduced by 8.9%, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the effect of varying the waste impurity percentage on supply chain performance, as source separation is believed to reduce system costs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, supply chain network design and management can significantly influence the economic viability of a biofuel technology. Fast pyrolysis offers several advantages for biofuel production. It is a relatively cheap process and can be conducted in centralized, decentralizes, or even mobile configurations. Furthermore, it does not overlap with the human food supply chain, using wastes or lignocellulosic feedstocks. In this article, a mixed integer (piece-wise) linear program (MILP) was developed to determine the optimal supply chain design and operation, under uncertainty. Rigorous process modelling and detailed economic analysis were coupled with exhaustive search of potential production locations and biomass resources in order to enhance the fidelity of the solution. The optimisation results suggest that a combination of geographically centralized pyrolysis and upgrading centres would suffice for supply chain management under deterministic conditions. However, under uncertain scenarios, it is advantageous to deploy mobile pyrolyzers to add extra flexibility to the process operation. Further analysis suggested that as the mobile pyrolyzers are commercialized and their unit price is reduced, this technology has the potential to become a key member of the biofuel supply chain. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Research has demonstrated the technical feasibility of using animal waste for energy conversion, though their supply chain cost poses a barrier, as does a gap in research regarding the specific design of efficient horse manure-to-energy supply chains. In response, we investigated the design of horse manure-to-energy supply chains through interviews and site visits at stables, as well as through interviews with transport companies. Our findings show that horse manure-to-energy supply chains have distinct attributes at all stages of the supply chain such as the geographical spread of stables that determines supply chain design and hampers efficiency. They share several such attributes with forest biomass-to-energy supply chains, from which important needs can be identified, including the industrial development of trucks dedicated to the purpose, mathematical modeling to handle the trade-off of cost of substance loss in storage and cost of transport, and business models that reconcile the conflicting goals of different actors along the supply chains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Most biomass studies have researched the best pathways or processes to upgrade this renewable raw material through stand-alone processes or biorefineries. The biomass supply chain is a crucial aspect in the economic analysis of biomass upgrading since most of the raw materials need to be transported. A supply chain analysis gives an idea about the availability, real costs, and storage conditions of the raw material to guarantee an accurate feasibility analysis and a standardized production process. Calendula (Calendula Officinalis) is an aromatic plant used to produce valuable extracts in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, high amounts of exhausted biomass (more than 95% w/w) are produced and wasted. Theseresidues represent an environmental issue to be solved through the implementation of valorizing options. This paper analyses the supply chain and environmental impact of essential oil production using Calendula (Calendula Officinalis) as a raw material in the Colombian context. The case study comprises a single-objective optimization of the calendula supply chain to produce essential oil and the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the process through a cradle-to-gate approach in the Colombian context. The results showed the best locations to upgrade Calendula in Colombia (i.e., Manizales and Bucaramanga), supplying 1.1 % of the total product demand. The optimal product flow to customers was 0.32 tons/year, and the required feedstock from suppliers was 162 tons/year. The agricultural stage of essential oil production represented the highest environmental impact of the supply chain. In particular, plastic sheets, organic fertilizers, and chemical fungicides were the main contributors to this impact. © 2020},

	abstract = {Biomass is becoming an increasingly widespread source of energy. Yet land, as one of the most important resources in biomass production, is surprisingly understudied in the literature of biomass supply chain planning. This study proposes a novel framework that combines the literature of bioethanol supply chain design with agricultural land planning to simultaneously address optimal supply chain planning and sustainable land use in a bioethanol supply chain. A bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to formulate the optimal design and planning of a bioethanol supply chain network considering competition of food and biomass feedstock over the available croplands. The proposed model is capable of making strategic decisions (i.e. locations and capacities of facilities, sourcing and allocation of biomass feedstocks to biorefineries), along with some tactical decisions (i.e. land planning, inventory and production of both biomass feedstock and bioethanol). The model incorporates the two objectives of minimum cost and maximum suitability of crops with their assigned croplands. A novel integration of the FAO framework, the best-worst multi-criteria decision-making method, PROMETHEE II and GIS is used to determine the suitability of available croplands according to the croplands’ soil and topographical characteristics. The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated through a multi-feedstock bioethanol supply chain in Fars province, Iran. It is concluded that the proposed integrated land planning-network design framework outperforms hierarchical approaches in which network design and land planning problems are solved separately in a sequential manner. Also, the case study shows that conditional on implementing second generation bioethanol production, Fars province has the potential to satisfy three percent of the fuel demand for transportation in the country. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study examines the advantages of incorporating a terminal for forest biomass in an advanced biofuels supply chain network. Forest biomass as a feedstock is non-uniform, voluminous and high in moisture content (MC). This leads to inefficiencies during transportation and energy conversion process, posing a challenge for supply chains to remain profitable. The problem is exacerbated by seasonality in both supply and demand. A terminal in the biomass feedstock supply chain could help overcome these challenges, but adds a significant cost. A novel multi-period mixed-integer programming (MIP) model capable of taking into consideration biomass quality, seasonality, and weather related supply restrictions was developed. The model was applied in a case study to assess the benefits of incorporating a terminal in the supply chain. It was demonstrated that a terminal allowed delivery of feedstock 4–11% lower in MC, while reducing procurement costs by 11–32%. The benefits reported are sensitive to transportation and operating costs. The proposed model will serve as a valuable tool for practitioners to design supply chains, and assess the feasibility of using forest biomass for sustainable biofuels production. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biomass has long been considered one of the most promising feedstock as an alternative primary source to substitute traditional fuels in the transport sectors. However, both biomass intrinsic variability and the fact that several conversion technologies have not reached full maturity make the economic assessment of the production system performance rather difficult. This paper proposes a quantitative approach for the strategic design and optimisation of biomass-based supply chains under uncertainty on technology conversion efficiency. The methodology is based on regret theory and allows quantifying both risk and regret with respect to benchmark economic outputs. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming is employed to represent and optimise the profitability of a multi-echelon, multi-period and spatially explicit biomass-based supply chain for bioethanol and bioelectricity production where several conversion technologies are simultaneously taken into account. The modelling framework includes biomass cultivation, transport, conversion, distribution and final usage in alternative fuel vehicles (running either on bioethanol or bioelectricity). Results demonstrate how the methodology can help policy-makers and investors assessing technological options according to their risk aversion attitude. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

BTS can be considered as a Parallel Machine Scheduling with a Single Server problem, where identical trucks (parallel machines) deliver biomass from satellite storage locations to a central biorefinery operating a single unloader (single server). We make two particular assumptions regarding the server: the server operation has a unit time length for each trip and idle periods are not allowed for it (server no idle time constraint). We consider two objective functions associated with the revealed HBSC logistic cost structure. First, the number of trucks is minimized (resource availability cost) following which the total truck idle time is minimized. Three mixed integer programming formulations are constructed to solve BTS, and their efficiency is evaluated using a number of test cases. We found that, even if the number of trucks is locked at its minimum value, there is always a schedule with zero truck idle time—that is, there is no trade-off between these two objective functions. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Conventional practices of siting all biomass preprocessing operations at the biorefinery is widely believed to be the most cost-effective solution for feedstock supply because of economies of scale. However, biomass preprocessing operations could be decentralized by moving the preprocessing operations to distributed biomass preprocessing centers, also known as “depots” located near biomass sources. This study presents a comparative case study with multiple biomass resources to analyze biorefinery feedstock supply logistics designs having distributed depots and a primary depot co-located with the biorefinery. A mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to simultaneously optimize feedstock sourcing decisions, and optimal preprocessing depot locations and size, utilizing biomass resources from agricultural residue, energy and municipal solid waste to meet carbohydrate specifications and feedstock demand for a biochemical conversion process. Results from a case study in the US showed that a biorefinery could increase its feedstock supply draw area and supply volume by 57.3%, 177.4% respectively without increasing the feedstock delivered cost by adopting distributed depot-in the feedstock supply chain design. A distributed-depot-based supply chain can be more economical by selecting optimal mix of biomass resource, optimal siting and depot scales during feedstock supply chain design. The findings from this study indicate that a biorefinery can utilize dynamic blending to meet the feedstock quality specifications as well as larger supply radius in the distributed depot-based supply chain design to access more available biomass to handle potential feedstock supply uncertainty. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Specifically, we first present how to extract crop data from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project packages, and then develop a method to combine these data with a historical cropland data layer, to generate spatial data with user-specified resolution. Next, we develop a general approach to determine the potential depot and biorefinery locations, and calculate the actual flow path distance between facilities using Geographic Information Systems methods. Since spatially explicit data lead to large-scale supply chain networks, we develop preprocessing algorithms that allow us to remove arcs that will never be used in an optimal solution, thereby reducing the size of the network under consideration. We then present a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming model that accounts for the selection of depot and biorefinery locations and their capacities, shipping and inventory planning, as well as the selection of pretreatment and conversion technologies, and transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our framework using a case study of corn stover-to-ethanol supply chain in Wisconsin. © 2018 The Authors},

The model coordinated strategic and tactical decisions. Strategic decisions include the number, capacity, and location of storage yards and biorefineries. Tactical decisions included the amount of biomass shipped, processed and inventoried during a time period. The model was validated using the state of Michigan, in the Midwest United States, as the base case. It was uncovered that trucks are preferred over rail for short-haul deliveries while rails are more effective for long-haul transport.

	abstract = {The use of new vehicle technologies such as fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric powertrains for biomass feedstock supply is an unexplored solution to reducing biofuel production cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and health impacts. These technologies have found success in light-duty vehicle applications and are in development for heavy-duty trucks. This study presents the first detailed stochastic techno-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment of biomass feedstock supply systems with diesel, fuel cell hybrid electric, and fully electric trucks and determines their impacts on biofuel production considering butanol as a representative biofuel. This study finds that fuel cell hybrid electric and fully electric trucks consume less energy relative to the diesel-powered truck regardless of the evaluated circumstances, including payloads of truck (loaded and empty), pavement types (gravel and paved), road conditions (normal and damaged), and road networks (local and highways). The use of fuel cell hybrid and fully electric trucks powered by H2-fuel and renewable sources of electricity, respectively, results in a large reduction in cost and carbon footprint, specifically for a long-distance hauling, and minimize other economic and environmental impacts. While the economic advantage of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle is dependent on the price of H2-fuel and road conditions, use reduces the GHG emissions of biobutanol per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.98–10.9 gCO2e/MJ. Results show that converting to fully electric truck transport decreases the biobutanol production cost and GHG emissions per 100 km-trucking-distance by 0.4–7.3 cents/L and 0.78 to 9.1 gCO2e/MJ, respectively.

	abstract = {To ensure an uninterrupted feedstock supply, commercial-scale cellulosic biofuel production facilities must consider using more than one type of biomass; this paper considers the use of poplar and wheat straw. Short rotation coppice poplar will be a competitive feedstock for future biorefineries because of the low cost and year-round availability. Wheat straw is seasonally available in Washington State and can potentially be added to woody biomass to fortify the feedstock supply chain when economically advantageous. In this study, blending of poplar whole-tree chips (PC) from short rotation coppice and wheat straw (WS) at the ratios of 25%/75%, 50%/50%, and 75%/25% were investigated for sugar conversion. Overall, the blends achieved up to 21% (90 kg/tonne) higher monomeric sugar yield than using PC as the sole feedstock. Economic analysis suggests that blending could be feasible for ethanol production provided WS can be obtained at a reasonable price ($60–$69/tonne). Blending of PC and WS allows feedstock flexibility and mitigates supply risks associated with biomass shortage, while maintaining a consistent process, robust product yields, and a stable product cost. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In sugarcane biorefineries, the lignocellulosic portion of the sugarcane biomass (i.e. bagasse and cane trash) can be used as fuel for electricity production and/or feedstock for second generation (2G) ethanol. This study presents a techno-economic analysis of upgraded sugarcane biorefineries in Brazil, aiming at utilizing surplus bagasse and cane trash for electricity and/or ethanol production. The study investigates the trade-off on sugarcane biomass use for energy production: bioelectricity versus 2G ethanol production. The BeWhere mixed integer and spatially explicit model is used for evaluating the choice of technological options. Different scenarios are developed to find the optimal utilization of sugarcane biomass. The study finds that energy prices, type of electricity substituted, biofuel support and carbon tax, investment costs, and conversion efficiencies are the major factors influencing the technological choice. At the existing market and technological conditions applied in the upgraded biorefineries, 300PJy-1 2G ethanol could be optimally produced and exported to the EU, which corresponds to 2.5% of total transport fuel demand in the EU. This study provides a methodological framework on how to optimize the alternative use of agricultural residues and industrial co-products for energy production in agro-industries considering biomass supply chains, the pattern of domestic energy demand, and biofuel trade. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This article provides a novel designing tool that integrates life cycle and techno-economic analysis in a spatially-explicit optimisation model for the supply chain for biomass-derived synthetic natural gas production from forestry residues, identifying the configurations, including number of plants, locations, sizes, that minimise the environmental and investment associated, necessary for a sustainable transition to a decarbonised gas network. Results show the conversion stage having the highest negative single-score environmental impact with 1725 μPt/MWh, mostly due to the use of rapeseed-oil methyl esters, collection of feedstock with 858 μPt/MWh, then feedstock transport with a maximum of 103 μPt/MWh. The use of rapeseed-oil methyl esters instead of mineral oil, the substitution of biomass-derived synthetic natural gas and co-produced electricity to the natural gas and electricity grids and their end-use provide a net environmental benefit of −1716 μPt/MWh in the conversion stage. However, the benefit is limited to climate change, ionising radiation, ozone depletion and resource depletion, while eutrophication and acidification potentials, photochemical ozone formation and particulate matter categories are damaged. The environmental impact of the supply chain per unit of MWh of biomass-derived synthetic natural gas produced is minimised when increasing the number of the plants and minimising their sizes, reducing the impact of transport. However, when the environmental impact is coupled to its cost, a single plant is the one that presents Pareto optimal solutions. Maps of the configurations that minimise the environmental impact per unit euro expended varying the number of plants are produced, confirming a 67.6 MW single plant as best solution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Envisioning a sustainable biorefinery requires reliable information on the sustainable availability of biomass, optimal plant location and delivered cost. In this paper, we have developed an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) based sustainable biomass assessment, site optimization and supply logistics cost model to assess the spatial and temporal availability of crop residues, to identify optimal plant sites and to calculate the delivered cost. The grid-level (30 × 30 m) assessment model was developed for crop residues using three primary sustainability indicators: (1) Soil Erosion (SE), (2) Soil Conditioning Index (SCI) and (3) Crop residue yield ⩾2.5 dry Mg/ha. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) prediction models for each indicator were developed and implemented in the GIS platform to assess sustainably available crop residues. A multi-criteria geospatial analysis was used to identify suitable plant sites. GIS-based location-allocation model was used to site biorefineries/plants at optimal locations and generate feedstock supply curves. The developed model was demonstrated with the sustainable assessment of cotton stalk (CS) to produce fuel pellets in the study region (Georgia, USA). The model has estimated that about 1.6 million dry Mg of CS is available annually to support seven pellet plants with an average annual plant capacity of 200,000 dry Mg. The average delivered cost of CS ranged between 68 and 75 $/dry Mg delivered as large rectangular bales with the transport radii ranged from 31 to 60 km. The spatial and temporal variations in the topology and crop yield directly influenced the sustainable availability of CS, the optimal plant location and its capacity and the delivered cost. However, the changes in the optimal plant location and delivered cost were minimal for large capacity plants (>400,000 dry Mg). The developed model can be used to assess multiple crop residues, to manage and control feedstock supply risks and delivered cost variations for a sustainable biorefinery. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biofuel production systems are identified as a potential solution to the ever-increasing energy consumption demand. The complexity of conversion process and supply chain of these systems, however, can make the commercialization of biofuels less attractive; therefore, designing and management of an efficient biofuel supply chain network can resolve this issue. Hence, this paper proposes a multi-period hybrid generation biomass-to-biofuel supply chain considering environmental, economic, and technological considerations. The objective is to maximize the total profit that biofuel producers can make with practical constraints including the biomass supply, the capacity of facilities, storage, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and transportation with limited capacity. To highlight the applicability of the proposed model, it is applied to a biomass-derived liquid fuel supply system in the southern region of Iran. In the case study, wheat and wheat stem are simultaneously considered as the first- and second-generation feedstocks for biodiesel production. Sensitivity analyses show that the available biomasses can have a significant impact on the profitability of this supply chain. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency and performance of the proposed model in biodiesel supply chain design. © Iran University of Science and Technology 2020},

Sensitivity analyses on required selling price (RSP) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of CBTL fuels were conducted according to feedstock availability and price, biomass to coal mix ratio, conversion rate, internal rate of return (IRR), capital cost, operational and maintenance cost. The results showed the price of coal had a more dominant effect on RSP than that of biomass. Different mix ratios and conversion rates led to RSP ranging from $104.3 – $157.9/bbl. LCA results indicated that GHG emissions ranged from 80.62 kg CO2 eq to 101.46 kg CO2 eq/1000 MJ of liquid fuel at various biomass to coal mix ratios and conversion rates if carbon capture and storage (CCS) was applied. Most of the water and fossil energy were consumed in the conversion process.

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate performances of different sorghum biomass feedstock logistics systems (S-BFLSs). To do so, we use a multi-period, mixed integer linear programming model to determine the optimal design for such systems. Our model prescribes strategic decisions pertaining to locations and sizes of storage facilities (called satellite storage locations, SSLs), the number of equipment sets to purchase, and allocation of farms to each SSL, as well as tactical decisions including period-to-period biomass transportation flows and period-to-period biomass inventory plans. We have studied a wide spectrum of options pertaining to harvest, preprocessing, and transportation including regular delivery and a hybrid of just-in-time and regular deliveries. Our model is applied to a potential region for biorefinery construction. Based on our analysis, when the biomass yield and equipment rate are deterministic, the most cost-effective S-BFLS consists of forage-chop for harvesting, bunkers or bags for ensiling, and a hybrid delivery system for biomass. However, when they are stochastic, non-ensiling options are quite competitive, generally better than an ensiling option except for ensiling using bunkers when the biomass yield is low. Ensiling by modules, in general, is not found to be as cost-effective as that by bags or bunkers because of the occurrence of high equipment ownership cost and operating cost. Compression of biomass for juice extraction is also not found to be cost-effective. Forage-chop harvest and whole-stalk harvest have little difference in economic effectiveness. A hybrid system for biomass delivery is recommended since it reduces logistics cost for all the configurations. © 2020},

	abstract = {Decision making in biomass supply chain management is subject to uncertainties in a number of factors such as biomass yield, procurement prices, market demands, transportation costs, and processing technologies. To better understand such uncertainties requires statistical analysis and data-intensive computing enabled by cyberGIS (aka geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure and e-science). Therefore, we have developed a cyberGIS approach to optimize biomass supply chains under uncertainties. Our approach (1) designs optimal biomass supply chains from regional to national scale with flexible spatial selection of study areas; (2) performs uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to quantify how various sources of uncertainty in the biomass supply chain contribute to the variation of optimal results; and (3) provides users with online geodesign features. This approach has been implemented as a decision support system through integration of data management, mathematical modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and result representation and visualization. An optimization modeling analysis of 7000 scenarios using Monte Carlo methods has been conducted to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity impact of various input factors on ethanol production costs and optimal biomass supply chain configurations in Illinois, United States. The results from uncertainty analysis showed that the minimal ethanol production costs range from $2.30 to $3.43 gal−1, considering uncertainties from biomass supply, transportation, and processing. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biomass-ethanol conversion rate was the most influential factor to ethanol production costs while the optimal biomass supply chain infrastructure was sensitive to changes in biomass yield, raw biomass transportation cost, and logistics loss rate. Leveraging high performance computing power through cutting-edge cyberGIS software, what-if scenario analysis has been evaluated to make decisions in case of unexpected events occurring in the supply chain operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In literature, anaerobic digestion of biomasses is commonly considered an environmental friendly way to treat and revalorise large amounts of by-products from farm industries because it could ensure both pollution control and energy recovery. This process is defined as the biological conversion of organic material to a variety of end products including 'biogas', the main constituents of which are methane (65-70%) and carbon dioxide. Citrus pulp is the main by-product of citrus processing industries and is composed of variable quantities of peel, pulp, and seeds. Recently, citrus pulp has been object of research studies because of its possible conversion from an ordinary by-product to an energy resource through an anaerobic digestion process. This possibility is of relevant importance also for reducing the environmental burden caused by disposal processes of the residues of citrus processing industries. At present, the lack of official data related to citrus pulp availability and spatial localisation has limited the reuse, exploitation, and valorisation of this by-product. Therefore, with the aim to fill this gap the objective of this study was to analyse the spatial distribution of the citrus producing areas and the amount of processed citrus in order to quantify the availability of citrus pulp for biogas production at a provincial level. To this aim a GIS-based model, previously defined and applied to evaluate the amount of citrus pulp production at a regional level, was applied to the case study of Catania province (Sicily, Italy). The results obtained in this study could constitute a valuable support for providing potential solutions to issues related to the environmental burden of citrus pulp disposal. Moreover, they could contribute to build an information base aimed at improving the sustainability of biogas sector, by helping to identify the best location for new biogas plants through the optimization of the logistics of biomasses supply in geographical areas where biogas sector is still developing.

	abstract = {The implementation of supply chains based on biomass conversion requires the exploration of various aspects, including the selection of processing technologies, configuration of the supply chain, portfolio of products as well as the feedstock selection. One important feature of this system is that the composition of the available biomass changes drastically through the year because this depends significantly on the climatic conditions; this way, the dynamic behavior of this process is an important issue that must be considered. This study presents a dynamic optimization model for the optimal planning of a distributed biorefinery system taking into account the time dependence of the involved variables and parameters. In addition, this paper incorporates a model predictive control methodology to obtain the behavior of the storages and orders of the supply chain; where the objective function is the difference between the required and satisfied demands in the markets. Therefore, this study considers relevant issues, which include the multiple available biomass feedstocks at various harvesting sites, the availability and seasonality of biomass resources, potential geographical locations for processing plants that produce multiple products using diverse production technologies, economies of scale for the production technologies, demands and prices of multiple products in each consumer, locations of storage facilities and a number of transportation modes between the supply chain components. The model was applied to a case study for a distributed biorefinery system in Mexico. Results show that is possible to get the configuration and the behavior of the supply chain considering its dynamic behavior in a rigorous way; furthermore, the solutions obtained by the model illustrate that the supply chains based on biomass conversion are seriously affected by the availability of bioresources over the time. © 2015 .},

	abstract = {Traditionally, biomass supply chain planning has been done hierarchically at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. Hierarchical planning might result in inconsistent or infeasible solutions at lower planning levels because short-term variations, e.g., those in biomass supply and demand, are not considered in long-term plans. To address this issue, an integrated strategic, tactical, and operational plan is developed in this paper in to consider the variations and details of lower planning levels. The integrated plan is developed as a hybrid model based on the recursive optimization-simulation approach. The optimization model integrates the strategic and tactical plans, while the simulation model incorporates the variations at the operational level. A procedure is developed to adjust the plans according to the variations in the model parameters using a feedback mechanism between the operational and the strategic/tactical level plans. The hybrid model is applied to a case study in British Columbia, Canada. The results show that the operational level variations and constraints could affect the long-term investment decisions and their profitability. For the given case study, the operational level variations decreased the estimated net present value by 21% due to the higher demand for logging residues. However, compared with the initial solution considered in the hybrid model, the final solution has a 17% higher net present value. The final design from the hybrid model suggests small-scale bioenergy and biofuel conversion facilities rather than large-scale ones as their demand for biomass could be met using more sawmill residues and less roadside logging residues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A decentralized supply chain that integrates biomass depots as an intermediate pre-processing hub may be an efficient way to obtain stable and dense non-food carbohydrate commodities that are economically transportable over long distances. This paper presents an integrated geographic information systems (GIS) method based on transport optimization to design and compare the performance of a decentralized versus a centralized biorefinery supply system. The method determines the suitable locations, allocations, sizing, and number of depots according to different demand location scenarios. The method is exemplified by a real case study in southern Quebec. In the design, the biomass depot generates raw sugar, shipped to the biorefinery, and co-products that are used on site without transportation as animal feed and bioenergy. This diversification strategy provided by a joint production permits savings amounting to two-thirds of the tonnage on the second transportation arc. The results present the average travel time performance in minutes in different scenarios. In the centralized configuration, the optimized stand-alone biorefinery location scenario is 45% (59 min) and 58% (100 min) more efficient in terms of transportation than the two biorefineries located in existing industrial parks. However, the latter have a decentralized configuration that is more efficient than their centralized equivalents. In the decentralized configuration, depending on farmer participation, the biorefineries located in the existing industrial park have a transportation performance 16–42% (27–55 min) that is more efficient than their respective centralized configuration. Smaller depots and the use of numerous depots tend to reduce the average impedance as biomass availability increases. This is due to the economies of transportation related to a denser and more meshed network. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {Biorefineries are increasingly important commercial facilities for the production of biofuels, biopower and various biomaterials from biomass with potentials to displace several existing industries currently based on polluting and finite fossil resources. Biorefinery systems consist of biorefinery facilities and their entire value chain. Integration of biorefinery systems aims at optimising the use of energies and materials in the total chain from biomass plantations to end product utilisation and is therefore capable of successfully improving economic viability and sustainability of biorefineries. Total Chain Integration can minimise capital and operating expenditures, maximise the quality, quantity and value of biorefinery bioproducts as well as minimise environmental impacts and maximise societal benefits. In order to efficiently perform Total Chain Integration advanced holistic software tools dedicated to biorefinery systems need to be developed. This review study systematically analyses Total Chain Integration of sustainable biorefinery systems. Existing knowledge is systematised by characterising system boundaries, principles, and integration methodologies. Further, approaches used in integration of biorefinery systems are defined and their implementation is briefly illustrated by case studies. Finally, state-of-the-art software tools for biorefinery integration are analysed and the requirements of a software tool for Total Chain Integration are provided. The review findings show that in order to develop truly economically viable and sustainable biorefinery systems tight integration is required. Essential integration approaches include integration of platforms, exchanging wastes and products with other industries, applying more efficient conversion routes, effective ways of enlarging feedstocks base, providing ecosystem and social services, and optimising biomass supply chain. Total Chain Integration requires software tools accounting for technical, economic, environmental and societal optimisation objectives within all system boundaries and the whole life cycle. The requirements of such software are proposed.

	abstract = {Diminishing fossil carbon resources, global warming, and increasing material and energy needs urge for the rapid development of a bioeconomy. Biomass feedstock from agro-industrial value chains provides opportunities for energy and material production, potentially leading to competition with traditional food and feed production. Simulation and optimization models can support the evaluation of biomass value chains and identify bioeconomy development paths, potentials, opportunities, and risks. This study presents the linkage of a farm model (EFEM) and a techno-economic location optimization model (BIOLOCATE) for evaluating the straw-to-energy and the innovative straw-to-chemical value chains in the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg taking into account the spatially distributed and price-sensitive nature of straw supply. The general results reveal the basic trade-off between economies of scale of the energy production plants and the biorefineries on the one hand and the feedstock supply costs on the other hand. The results of the farm model highlight the competition for land between traditional agricultural biomass utilization such as food and feed and innovative biomass-to-energy and biomass-to-chemical value chains. Additionally, farm-modeling scenarios illustrate the effect of farm specialization and regional differences on straw supply for biomass value chains as well as the effect of high straw prices on crop choices. The technological modeling results show that straw combustion could cover approximately 2% of Baden-Wuerttemberg's gross electricity consumption and approximately 35% of the district heating consumption. The lignocellulose biorefinery location and size are affected by the price sensitivity of the straw supply and are only profitable for high output prices of organosolv lignin. The location optimization results illustrate that economic and political framework conditions affect the regional distribution of biomass straw conversion plants, thus favoring decentralized value chain structures in contrast to technological economies of scale. © 2018 The Authors.

The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Using forest-based biomass to produce bio-energy and bio-fuels could provide economic, environmental, and social benefits for communities. However, variability in biomass availability and high cost of delivered feedstock impact the profitability of the supply chain. Therefore, optimization models were developed in previous studies to design cost effective and profitable biomass-based supply chains at strategic level. Medium term variations in biomass supply and demand are not usually accounted for in strategic models. This may affect the feasibility of strategic plans prescribed by the optimization model at tactical level. To solve this issue, an integrated model is developed in this paper that includes strategic and tactical decisions simultaneously in order to optimize forest-based biomass supply chains. In addition to yearly variations in biomass supply, which can occur due to changes in harvest level, monthly variations in biomass availability, bioenergy/biofuels demand, and losses during preprocessing and storage of biomass are incorporated in the model. Other unique features of this model compared to the few integrated models developed in previous studies are as follows. (1) Decision regarding opening a new conversion facility is made yearly, not just at the beginning of the planning horizon. (2) A multi-product (heat, electricity, bio-oil and pellets) supply chain is considered. (3) The impact of fossil-based energy prices on bio-conversion investment decisions are accounted for in the model. (4) The optimization problem is modeled in a way that the global optimum solution is obtained within a reasonable time. Using a case study in Interior British Columbia, it is shown in the paper that the capacity of conversion technologies and the amount of procured biomass prescribed by the strategic model would not be sufficient to meet the monthly demand of bioenergy. Moreover, the net present value of the strategic model is overestimated due to underestimating the demand and procurement cost, and ignoring storage costs. It is shown that these issues are resolved using the integrated model. © 2017},

This paper aims to render an optimization model for designing a resilient and reliable biomass-to-biofuel supply chain network in which multi-modal terminals, biorefineries, and their connection link could be faced with disruption. For this purpose, risk-averse optimization, transitional probabilities, and spatial statistics models are employed. What is more, to overcome the repercussions of uncertain demand and the availability of raw materials, risk pooling and M/M/1 queuing system are considered. Finally, since the proposed model is an NP-hard problem, two meta-heuristic algorithms called improved ray optimization and colliding bodies optimization are employed to solve the proposed model. Computational results reveal that by increasing 20% of the conversion rate of biomass to biofuel, which leads to increase biomass supply, biofuel production increases by 20.88%, and the SC cost declines by 9.32% due to the better capacity distribution of bio-refineries. Also, the proposed model increases by 20.87% in the total SC costs under random disruptions than the risk-neutral model, although the failure costs of SC decline by 80.45%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this article, a multiobjective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to address the optimal design and planning of a lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain (LBSC) considering a sustainable supply chain optimization framework including economic, environmental, and social objectives. The proposed model is capable of determining strategic decisions, including biomass sourcing and allocation, locations, capacity levels, and technology types of biorefinery facilities, as well as the tactical decisions, including inventory levels, production amounts, and shipments among the network. Eco-indicator 99, which is a well-known life-cycle-assessment- (LCA-) based environmental impact assessment method, is incorporated into the model to estimate the relevant environmental impacts. To handle the inherent uncertainty of the input data in the problem of interest, a novel multiobjective robust possibilistic programming (MORPP) approach is developed. The performance of the model is demonstrated through a case study developed for a biofuel supply chain in Iran. Diverse solutions achieved by the proposed MORPP approach outperform deterministic solutions in terms of given performance measures. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

These facts make the process of biomass supply chain as a complex system that requires computational tools, e.g. simulation and mathematical models, for their assessment and analysis. A biomass supply chain simulation model developed on the ExtendSim 8 simulation environment is presented in this paper. A number of sequential operations are applied in order biomass to be mowed, harvested, and transported to a biorefinery facility. Different operational scenarios regarding the travel distance between field and biorefinery facility, number of machines, and capacity of machines are analyzed showing how different parameters affect the processes within biomass supply chain in terms of time and cost. The results shown that parameters such as area of the field, travel distance, number of available machines, capacity of the machines, etc. should be taken into account in order a less time and/or cost consuming machinery combination to be selected. © 2016, International Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

However, scattered distribution, low energy density, and the strong harvest seasonality of forestry and agricultural residues restrict their effective recycling. Therefore, this study aims to establish a reasonable, efficient, and low-cost recycling network. First, the main features and basic attributes of forestry and agricultural residues were analyzed, and different forms of recycling networks were proposed according to differences in the process from sourcing to processing and utilization. A location-route collaborative decision-making optimization model was established to determine the overall layout of the recycling network and transportation routes based on a comprehensive consideration of the node capacity of the recycling network and the cost of transportation routes. An improved genetic algorithm was proposed according to the model characteristics to solve the model, which had an efficient operation, good optimization, and strong convergence. Finally, effectiveness and feasibility of the model and the algorithm were verified through an example. Research results provide theoretical references to solve the recycling problem of forestry and agricultural residues and reduce the logistics costs.},

In the early design stage, data for a detailed design is scarce rendering an in-depth analysis of all possibilities challenging. In this contribution, the screening methodology process network flux analysis (PNFA) is introduced assessing systematically the cost and energy performance of processing pathways. Based on the limited data available, a ranking of biorefinery pathways and a detection of bottlenecks is achieved by considering the reaction performance as well as the feasibility and energy demand of various separation strategies using thermodynamic sound shortcut models. PNFA is applied to a network of six gasoline biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. While 2-butanol is ruled out due to a lack in yield and selectivity, iso-butanol and 2-butanone are identified as economically promising fuels beyond ethanol.

	abstract = {This contribution addresses the optimal design of the biomass supply chain as it is crucial to ensure long term viability of such a project. This work is focused on the multi objective optimization by considering all the dimension of the sustainable development, namely economic, environmental, and social. The environmental dimension is quantified through life cycle assessment, and more particularly the Ecocosts method. The social aspect is measured through two indicators: the competition between energy and food, and the total number of local accrued jobs. For the latter a new method based on financial accounting analysis is proposed to estimate the direct, indirect and induced jobs created. Once the superstructure described, the optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that accounts for biomass seasonality, geographical availability, biomass degradation, process conversion technologies and final product demand. The output results of the model propose the optimal network design, facilities location, process selection and inventory policy. Since multiple conflicting objectives are involved when optimizing the sustainability of the biomass supply chain and the binary variables have an important influence on the resolution, the MILP problem is solved with the goal programming method to reach the trade-off. The approach is illustrated through a bioethanol supply chain case study in France, for the comparison between agricultural and forest residues biomass. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {As fossil fuels are depleted worldwide, alternative resources is required to replace fossil fuels, and biofuels are in the spotlight as alternative resources. Biofuels are produced from biomass, which is a renewable resource to produce biofuels or bio-chemicals. Especially, in order to substitute fossil fuels, the research focusing the biofuel (biodiesel) production based on CO2 and biomass achieves more attention recently. To produce biomass-based biodiesel, the development of a supply chain network is required considering the amounts of feedstocks (ex, CO2 and water) required producing biodiesel, potential locations and capacities of bio-refineries, and transportations of biodiesel produced at biorefineries to demand cities. Although many studies of the biomass-based biodiesel supply chain network are performed, there are few types of research handled the uncertainty in CO2 supply which influences the optimal strategies of microalgae-based biodiesel production. Because CO2, which is used in the production of microalgae-based biodiesel as one of important resources, is captured from the off-gases emitted in power plants, the uncertainty in CO2 supply from power plants has big impacts on the optimal configuration of the biodiesel supply chain network. Therefore, in this study, to handle those issues, we develop the two-stage stochastic model to determine the optimal strategies of the biodiesel supply chain network considering the uncertainty in CO2 supply. The goal of the proposed model is to minimize the expected total cost of the biodiesel supply chain network considering the uncertain CO2 supply as well as satisfy diesel demands at each city. This model conducted a case study satisfying 10% diesel demand in the Republic of Korea. The overall cost of the stochastic model (US$ 12.9/gallon·y) is slightly higher (23%) than that of the deterministic model (US$ 10.5/gallon·y). Fluctuations in CO2 supply (stochastic model) had a significant impact on the optimal strategies of the biodiesel supply network. © 2020 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Biomass is an important energy source that has the ability to reduce dependencies on fossil fuels, while providing a greener source of energy and helping achieve sustainability. Among the most commonly used biomass feedstock is corn stover, corn residue remaining in the fields after harvesting. One of the biggest challenges of using corn stover as biomass feedstock is that burning it in field is the fastest and cheapest way for many growers so as to remove it and grow new crops. This leftover corn stover could be, instead, converted to bioethanol. In this work, we propose a decision support system for expanding existing biorefineries or building new ones to help stakeholders design a supply chain network model that converts all of the available corn stover to bioethanol. Two configurations presented in this study which is the existing plant expansion (EP) configuration and the combination of existing and new plant configuration (ENP), by exploring the incentive and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission price value for the bioenergy plant to achieve the goal. The aim of converting all corn stover is successfully achieved along with the other goals of achieving sustainability by reducing the amount of GHG emissions in the supply chain. Our results reveal that we can achieve a minimum amount of GHG emissions, while maximizing profit from the supply chain, when expanding existing plants and building new plants (ENP configuration) leading to a reduction of GHG emissions by 4%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In Australia, Bioenergy plays an important role in modern power systems, where many biomass resources provide greenhouse gas neutral and electricity at a variety of scales. By 2050, the Biomass energy is projected to have a 40-50 % share as an alternative source of energy. In addition to conversion of biomass, barriers and uncertainties in the production, supply may hinder biomass energy development. The sugarcane is an essential ingredient in the production of Bioenergy, across the whole spectrum ranging from the first generation to second generation, e.g., production of energy from the lignocellulosic component of the sugarcane initially regarded as waste (bagasse and cane residue). Sustainable recovery of the Lignocellulosic component of sugarcane from the field through a structured process is largely unknown and associated with high capital outlay that have stifled the growth of bioenergy sector. In this context, this paper develops a new scheduler to optimise the recovery of lignocellulosic component of sugarcane and cane, transport and harvest systems with reducing the associated costs and operational time. An Optimisation Algorithm called Limited Discrepancy Search has been adapted and integrated with the developed scheduling transport algorithms. The developed algorithms are formulated and coded by Optimization Programming Language (OPL) to obtain the optimised cane and cane residues transport schedules. Computational experiments demonstrate that high-quality solutions are obtainable for industry-scale instances. To provide insightful decisions, sensitivity analysis is conducted in terms of different scenarios and criteria. © 2018 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is widely applied in sustainability problems where several objectives must be accounted for in the analysis. Unfortunately, its complexity grows with the number of objectives, which hampers its practical use. In this paper, we simplify MOO problems via their combination with multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods. The approach identifies a unique Pareto solution of the MOO problem, which best reflects the decision-makers’ preferences, by using weighting factors generated via four well-known MADM methods: SWING, SMART, AHP and TRADE OFF. The capabilities of this approach are illustrated through its application to the design and planning of a sugar/ethanol supply chain using questionnaires filled in by academic experts in the problem. We find that the weights obtained using MADM algorithms may well differ from the ones given by standard life-cycle assessment methods employed in systems engineering problems. Overall, our approach simplifies the MOO problem by identifying solutions consistent with the decision-makers’ preferences and by providing valuable insight on how these preferences are articulated in practice. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A superstructure considering multiple options for each processing stage is developed. Mass and energy balance equations along with fuel demand and feedstock availability equations constitute the model constraints. Process selection decisions and the mass flows are the decision variables, and minimization ethanol production cost for a specific production target is the objective function. The model determined the minimum ethanol cost to be Rs. 70/l ($ 1.05/l) for a biorefinery producing 100 Mg/month of ethanol. Dilute acid pretreatment and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSCF) were the optimal process selections. Pretreatment selection had a significant impact on the ethanol cost.

	abstract = {We present an overview of results from 11 integrated assessment models (IAMs) that participated in the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-33) on the viability of large-scale deployment of bioenergy for achieving long-run climate goals. The study explores future bioenergy use across models under harmonized scenarios for future climate policies, availability of bioenergy technologies, and constraints on biomass supply. This paper provides a more transparent description of IAMs that span a broad range of assumptions regarding model structures, energy sectors, and bioenergy conversion chains. Without emission constraints, we find vastly different CO2 emission and bioenergy deployment patterns across models due to differences in competition with fossil fuels, the possibility to produce large-scale bio-liquids, and the flexibility of energy systems. Imposing increasingly stringent carbon budgets mostly increases bioenergy use. A diverse set of available bioenergy technology portfolios provides flexibility to allocate bioenergy to supply different final energy as well as remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by combining bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). Sector and regional bioenergy allocation varies dramatically across models mainly due to bioenergy technology availability and costs, final energy patterns, and availability of alternative decarbonization options. Although much bioenergy is used in combination with CCS, BECCS is not necessarily the driver of bioenergy use. We find that the flexibility to use biomass feedstocks in different energy sub-sectors makes large-scale bioenergy deployment a robust strategy in mitigation scenarios that is surprisingly insensitive with respect to reduced technology availability. However, the achievability of stringent carbon budgets and associated carbon prices is sensitive. Constraints on biomass feedstock supply increase the carbon price less significantly than excluding BECCS because carbon removals are still realized and valued. Incremental sensitivity tests find that delayed readiness of bioenergy technologies until 2050 is more important than potentially higher investment costs. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Biomass utilization in the generation of bioenergy and biofuels is promoted as a sustainable solution to decarbonise the energy sector. Effective management of biomass supply chain is pivotal to successful deployment of this energy-rich resource in the power sector. Using a case study in Malaysia where biomass feedstock sourcing problem is prevalent, a biomass supply chain system was proposed. Three important terminals were identified, namely; i) biomass supply point (BSP), where raw biomass materials are collected, ii) biomass processing facility (BPF), as the collection hub cum centralized conversion centre, and iii) biomass demand centre (BDC), where the processed biomass meets the end-use sectors. A new modelling approach was proposed to optimize the new BPF location with the objective to minimize total road travelling distance between each terminal. The results were compared with the other commonly used methods, namely centre of gravity and fuzzy clustering. The positive contributions of the proposed model in minimizing the overall logistic cost and CO2 emissions due to fuel consumption were discussed. © 2019, Dorma Journals. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Transportable biomass conversion facilities producing biochar, briquettes, and torrefied wood are modeled and optimized for five different sub-regions within the Pacific Northwest. Subregional case studies in Quincy, California; Lakeview, Oregon; Oakridge, Oregon; Port Angeles, Washington; and Warm Springs, Oregon, are evaluated to characterize the potential economic viability of these novel transportable designs. A mixed integer program is used to characterize the supply chain from residue extraction to market optimizing transportation, production, and plant mobility in order to minimize the supply chain costs. Regional variations including log specifications, energy rates, trucking, and logistic capacities are considered within the model and supporting analyses to differentiate regional costs and market viabilities. It was found that the optimal transportable design included facility movement on a 1 to 2.5 year frequency depending on product and region with biochar being the most likely to be economically viable. Regional feedstock composition and availability was the biggest indicator of lower cost production. Supply chain costs varied by 5%-10% depending on product and region being produced. Transportation and mobilization were found to account for 15%-30% of the overall supply chain cost. Quincy, California, and torrefied wood were found to have the lowest of these costs due to low move frequency and high wood availability while Port Angeles, Washington, with briquettes was the highest. With regards to fuel price sensitivity, torrefied wood was the most sensitive as its conversion process was most energy intensive (±12%-13%) and biochar least sensitive (±3-5%).Transportation accounted for 5% to 30% of the fuel price variation due to diesel prices depending on product and region. When including grid-connectivity, cost reductions were approximately 6%-7% for biochar, 27%-29% for briquettes and 33%-38% for torrefied wood. These findings indicate biochar as the most likely candidate for a transportable conversion system given its relatively low power consumption, high allowable moisture content, and low product transportation cost. Quincy, California, was found to be the most desirable sub region with the lowest overall production costs attributed to its high input quality feedstock and relative accessibility; its higher grid-connected power cost also makes transportable options relatively more attractive than other off-grid locations. Port Angeles, WA had the highest production costs and lowest grid-energy costs. Our results indicate that a rise in diesel price, while incentivizing transportable conversion facilities due to more cost effective transportation, would be more than offset by the higher cost energy consumption during the conversion process when compared with grid-power with the potential exception of biochar. Overall, we see a transportable operation with grid-power would likely be the difference between an economically viable supply chain and one that is not. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

	abstract = {Biomass residues due to their low bulk density typically require frequent transportation from biomass plantations in rural areas to conversion bio-energy power plants. This issue contrasts with environmental protection strategies, especially when power plants are facing different carbon reduction policies that enforce them to emit less than a given specific carbon amount. Although several researchers have investigated bio-energy supply chains concerning environmental policies, the majority of studies have been devoted to strategic decisions over a single planning period. This paper presents a multi-period bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing (carbon tax) and carbon trading (cap-and-trade) policies at the tactical planning level. A mixed-integer linear programming model was adopted to optimize the proposed regional oil-palm biomass-to-bio-energy supply chain planning model. The numerical results indicate that when carbon pricing is in place when carbon tax increases linearly, carbon emissions’ reductions have a nonlinear trend, whereas both cost increase and carbon emissions’ reductions have a relatively upward trend in the carbon trading scheme. This paper also presents the sensitivity analysis of the proposed model regarding cost, emissions’ generation and supply chain performance. Finally, the paper recommends several significant practical implications and policy-making insights for managers and policymakers. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Second generation biofuels offer the opportunity to mitigate emissions from the growing transportation sector while respecting the scarcity of arable land in agriculture. Biomass-to-liquid (BtL) concepts based on large-scale gasification are capable of using low-quality residual feedstock, such as wheat straw or forest residues, for the production of transportation fuels. However, large amounts of biomass feedstock are required to achieve the economic capacity of a synthesis plant. Depending on the steepness of the terrain and the role of feedstock owners, biomass potentials can only be utilized to a large extent at increasing costs per ton. Such diseconomies of scale are particularly problematic in the presence of already established value chains consuming the easily accessible and low-cost feedstock. As a result, second-generation biofuel supply chains face steep supply curves with sharply increasing unit costs. This article investigates the impact of established utilization paths on a large-scale biofuel production value chain. To do so, a mixed-integer linear model is presented which first determines the allocation of biomass resources to CHP plants and domestic consumers. Based on the resulting costs and supply curves, the model then determines the optimum configuration of the synfuel supply chain including locations and capacities of conversion plants, feedstock procurement and transportation. The model is applied to a case study covering six regions in south-central Chile. The total supply chain cost for the production of synthetic gasoline is estimated to amount to 0.8–0.9 € per liter. Feedstock costs of the synfuel supply chain are 20–50% higher in comparison to the price paid by CHP plants and households. The results indicate that both torrefaction and fast pyrolysis can be applied beneficially to utilize remote biomass resources which are less in demand by established consumers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The harvesting moment is defined and pre-treatment operations are introduced to make sure that biomass is delivered with characteristics that fit best these requirements. The analyses indicate that storage facilities are indispensable to deal with the temporal availability of biomass, the conflicting temporal demand and the required constant feeding of the digesters. t-OPTIMASS allows users, interested in macro-analysis, to define biomass potentials, to support policy decisions, to evaluate the feasibility of new facilities, etc. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {It is estimated that 12–15% of total global industrial energy is consumed by the Cement Manufacturing Industry (CMI). To improve environmental sustainability, biomass has been used as an alternative to fossil fuels. There is a comprehensive literature on biomass production and conversion, but little attention has been paid to biomass logistics in the cement industry. We propose the use of cement distribution trucks to collect biomass on their return journeys. Compared with the use of specialist biomass suppliers, the collection of biomass via cement distribution networks has greater uncertainties in delivery times, volume and quality. This is because biomass collection is a secondary activity and is subject to cement order quantities and the random geographical locations of cement customers. To cope with these uncertainties, additional on-site storage and handling equipment is required. This paper proposes a stochastic programming model to measure the cost-effectiveness of collecting biomass using returning cement distribution trucks in comparison with purchasing biomass from specialised biomass suppliers. A numerical experiment based on a real-word dataset was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the developed model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biomass supply chain has been extended to cope with the growing concern on sustainability development and cleaner production. Process network optimisation is no longer sufficient to improve the biomass product life cycle. A comprehensive and systematic debottlenecking approach is required to identify and subsequently remove the underlying bottlenecks which hinder the biomass industry from attainment of sustainable paradigm. Therefore, this paper introduced a novel debottlenecking approach that incorporates P-graph framework and sustainability index (SI) to address the aforementioned issue. In addition, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to determine the appropriate priority scale for each sustainability dimension, including economic sustainability (annual revenue), environmental sustainability (pollutants emission) and social sustainability (safety aspect). Three different scenarios (palm oil mill effluent (POME) valorisation, oil palm frond (OPF) valorisation and biomass selection for gasification) which obtained from a Malaysia case study, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed debottlenecking method is capable to identify the bottlenecks of the research problem easily and efficiently (i.e., all three scenarios show positive outcome since the satisfaction level of the given technology pathways or biomass option have been gradually improved after debottlenecking). On top of that, the strengths and limitations of the proposed method are also discussed in this paper. This research is expected to be beneficial to the nation's biomass industry in the development of biomass industry. © 2018},

	abstract = {Variability on the physical characteristics of feedstock has a relevant effect on the reactor's reliability and operating cost. Most of the models developed to optimize biomass supply chains have failed to quantify the effect of biomass quality and preprocessing operations required to meet biomass specifications on overall cost and performance. The Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) model estimates the harvesting, collection, transportation, and storage cost while considering the stochastic behavior of the field-to-biorefinery supply chain. This paper proposes an IBSAL-SimMOpt (Simulation-based Multi-Objective Optimization) method for optimizing the biomass quality and costs associated with the efforts needed to meet conversion technology specifications. The method is developed in two phases. For the first phase, a SimMOpt tool that interacts with the extended IBSAL is developed. For the second phase, the baseline IBSAL model is extended so that the cost for meeting and/or penalization for failing in meeting specifications are considered. The IBSAL-SimMOpt method is designed to optimize quality characteristics of biomass, cost related to activities intended to improve the quality of feedstock, and the penalization cost. A case study based on 1916 farms in Ontario, Canada is considered for testing the proposed method. Analysis of the results demonstrates that this method is able to find a high-quality set of non-dominated solutions. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The growth in energy demand, coupled with declining fossil fuel resources and the onset of climate change, has resulted in increased interest in renewable energy, particularly from biomass. Co-firing, which is the joint use of coal and biomass to generate electricity, is seen to be a practical immediate solution for reducing coal use and the associated emissions. However, biomass is difficult to manage because of its seasonal availability and variable quality. This study proposes a biomass co-firing supply chain optimization model that simultaneously minimizes costs and environmental emissions through goal programming. The economic costs considered include retrofitting investment costs, together with fuel, transport, and processing costs, while environmental emissions may come from transport, treatment, and combustion activities. This model incorporates the consideration of feedstock quality and its impact on storage, transportation, and pre-treatment requirements, as well as conversion yield and equipment efficiency. These considerations are shown to be important drivers of network decisions, emphasizing the importance of managing biomass and coal blend ratios to ensure that acceptable fuel properties are obtained. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biomass has the potential to create sustainable energy systems, which is critical for societal welfare. A major issue regarding biomass resources is crop residues or leftover biomass that is burnt by farmers after harvesting; this happens due to high transportation costs which make burning the cheapest way to remove the residue. We develop a decision support system using a large-scale linear program with the goal of maximizing profit with and without the emission cost. This system helps identify farms that would benefit society were they to be incentivized under a biomass crop assistance program (BCAP). A case study of leftover corn stover in the state of North Dakota is analyzed to validate the model. Our results reveal that an incentive of $7.20 per ton of corn stover converted to ethanol when 20% of rail capacity is allocated is ideal, as it produces the lowest emissions of 16,784,953 metric tons with a $73,462,599 profit. Furthermore, penalizing emissions resulting from the transportation of corn stover also helps reduce emissions; a suitable value for the penalty could be $71.7 per metric ton of CO2 emitted. Such a policy would result in reducing dependency on petroleum, thus promoting a sustainable biomass supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Optimization models can help decision makers to design more efficient chains and minimize the cost of biomass delivered to the refineries. This article based on a French national research project on biomass logistics considers one refinery, able to process several crops and several parts of the same crop, over a one-year horizon divided into days or weeks. A network model and a data model are first developed to let the decision maker describe the supply chain structure and its data, without affecting the underlying mathematical model. The latter is a mixed integer linear program which combines for the first time various features, either original or tackled separately in the literature. Knowing the refinery demands, it determines the activity levels in the network (amounts harvested, baled, transported, stored, etc.) and the required equipment, in order to minimize a total cost including harvesting costs, transport costs and storage costs. Numerical evaluations based on real data show that the proposed model can optimize large supply chains in reasonable running times. © 2018 Brazilian Operations Research Society.},

In order to accelerate the commercialization of M. oleifera-based biodiesel, this paper develops a two-stage optimization model for the design of an efficient M. oleifera biomass to biodiesel supply chain. In the first stage, a common weight data envelopment analysis (CWDEA) model is utilized to rank locations threatened by desertification and land degradation. The locations with high vulnerability are introduced as candidate locations into the second stage in which a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to systematically design and optimize the entire supply chain and determine the optimal strategic and tactical supply chain decisions. To illustrate the application of the developed model, a case study in semi-arid lands of Iran is conducted. The results indicate that M. oleifera biodiesel production is not competitive with petroleum-based fuels but there is considerable room for cost reduction through improvement in M. oleifera productivity and oil conversion rate. Moreover, the areas at risk of desertification can be reclaimed by an increase of only 5% in the total supply chain cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {High logistics and handling costs prevent the bioenergy industry from making a greater contribution to the present energy market. Therefore, a mathematical model, OPTIMASS, is presented to optimise strategic (e.g. facility location and type) and tactical (e.g. allocation) decisions in all kinds of biomass-based supply chains. In addition to existing models, OPTIMASS evaluates changes in biomass characteristics due to handling operations which is needed to meet the requirements set to biomass products delivered at a conversion facility. Also, OPTIMASS considers the re-injection of by-products from conversion facilities which can play a decisive role in the determination of a sustainable supply chain. The scenario analysis illustrates the functionalities of OPTIMASS in the optimisation of an existing supply chain, the definition of the optimal location of new conversion facilities and the definition of the optimal configuration of a supply chain. OPTIMASS, as a deterministic model, does not consider variability related to e.g. seasonal changes which can be a major obstacle. However, a thorough sensitivity analysis of influencing factors must give insight in the induced changes in the supply chain. The sensitivity analysis in this paper investigates the influence of uncertainty in biomass production, energy demand and of changes in transport distance. The analysis demonstrates that OPTIMASS can be used as an inspiring tool to investigate the possible effects of governmental decisions, of considering new biomass material, new facilities, of technology changes, etc. The coupling with GIS allows characterisation and visualisation of problems in advance and visualisation of results in an interpretative way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Biomass to biofuel supply chain is subject to several potential disruptions such as flood, drought, pest attack, and equipment failure. These disruptions must be considered while designing the supply chain; especially if capital cost intensive components such as regional biomass pre-processing depots (RBPD) are to be implemented. This work develops a supply chain design optimization model that incorporates the possibility of such disruptions at the design stage. The objective function is the sum of the total cost incurred during the non-disruption and disruption scenarios weighted by their respective probability of occurrence. This also quantifies the expected disruption cost (EDC) on the operation of the supply chain. The decision variables are the locations and capacities of RBPDs and biorefinery, as well as the biomass flow across the supply chain. The model was applied to two separate case studies, namely, procurement of corn stover from farms arranged in a generic grid pattern, and procurement of corn stover, switchgrass, and Miscanthus for a region of thirteen counties in Southern Illinois. The simulation results showed that the consideration of resiliency in design reduced the EDC of supply chain by up to 38% by optimizing the RBPD locations. The results were shown to depend on the intensity and nature of disruptions. This was especially true for feedstock with higher yield such as Miscanthus. Local parameters such as yield and biomass price also affected the optimal results. Moreover, the presence of RBPDs was shown to increase supply chain resiliency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

This study evaluates potential pathways for the utilization of biomass in Brazil until 2050, while considering novel biobased sectors (renewable jet fuel and biochemicals), resource competition, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Whereas other least-cost optimization models assess biobased options to meet energy and chemicals demand in Brazil to a limited extent, this study provides a detailed breakdown of biomass feedstock, including an extensive portfolio of biomass conversion technologies. A least-cost optimization model is used to assess the demand for energy and chemicals, and the competition between biomass and other climate-mitigation measures such as renewable power generation technologies, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy efficiency. Varied over the three scenarios, 86–96% of the sustainable biomass supply potential is used. Under more stringent mitigation targets, novel biomass conversion technologies start to play an important role: Biobased electricity production with CCS, jet fuel production from lignocellulosic biomass, and chemicals are partly produced from ethanol and bio-naphtha. The modeling framework provides a transparent view of which type of biomass can be used for which specific purpose. It is therefore an interesting tool for future research, for example to examine the dynamic interaction with demand for land. © 2019 The Authors.

The supply chain consists of farms, Regional Biomass Pre-processing Depots (RBPD), and biorefineries. The disruption, in the form of drought, has spatially varying disruption probability and level of actual disruption. Shortfall in fuel production and short term procurement of feedstock incurs penalty. Mass balance equations constitute the constraints. Decision variables include design decision (biorefinery and RBPD locations and capacities) and operational decisions (feedstock flows). The objective function is the minimization of the probability-weighted sum of ideal and disrupted scenario costs. The results, for a case study with 443 farms, 16 potential RBPDs, and 5 potential biorefinery locations, are compared with a model that ignored disruption. The results show up to 7.6% reduction in the actual cost with the proposed model.

	abstract = {The impacts of price and sustainability on municipal waste disposal demand have largely been ignored by waste management researchers. This paper considers a waste disposal supply chain that includes a disposal facility and a contractor. Both parties try to improve source sorting for waste collection to reduce the recycling cost at the disposal facility. Improving source sorting requires investment that would increase the price of the waste disposal service, thereby affecting the price-sensitive demand. The relationship between the service price and investments in waste sorting motives is analyzed in this paper via studying the trade-off between the optimal source sorting and the waste disposal service prices. Different scenarios based on the various players’ power structures are developed. Nash and Stackelberg games have been applied in order to find the optimal decision values in each scenario. The impact of cost sharing on optimal supply chain decisions is also studied. The numerical results show that the waste supply chain is more profitable when it is working under an integrated management structure. Moreover, reducing the required investment motivates supply chain players to select higher levels of waste sorting at the source. A numerical example is provided, followed by some managerial insights. © The Author(s) 2019.},

The proposed framework consists of two simulation phases: (1) crop yield estimation using a process-based model such as Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) and (2) biomass transportation cost estimation using agent-based simulation (ABS) such as AnyLogic® with geographic information system (GIS). The OptQuest® in AnyLogic is used as an optimization engine to find the best locations of biomass storage facilities based on evaluation results given by the two-phase simulation framework. In addition, network partitioning and integer linear programming techniques are used to mitigate computation demand of the optimization problem. Since the proposed hybrid simulation approach utilizes realistic biofuel feedstock production and considers dynamics of supply chain activities, it is able to provide reliable locations of biomass storage facilities for operational excellence of a biomass supply chain. © 2018},

An optimal management strategy should be based on creating synergistic opportunities that benefit the multiple participants. This paper presents a multi-objective optimization approach for the strategic planning of a municipal solid waste management system. The formulation considers the involved tasks such as recycle, reuse, transportation, separation, and distribution. The proposed approach also accounts for the multiple stakeholders with the objective of maximizing the benefit to all the participating stakeholders. The Latin Hypercube sampling technique is adopted to systematically generate weights for the different stakeholders. A case study from Mexico is analyzed where three scenarios are considered. The first one considers that the separation cost is absorbed by each recycling company. The second one assumes that the government is responsible for the separation cost. The third one requires household inhabitants to carry out waste sorting. The optimization approach is used to analyze the results of the various scenarios and to deduce valuable insights on the interaction among the various stakeholders and the building blocks of the supply chain of MSW management systems. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

This paper contributes towards optimizing a biomass-to-bioproducts supply chain planning operation by considering multiple cost factors including biomass resource acquisition cost, production cost, and transportation cost as well as direct sales to meet market demands. A superstructure-based modeling approach provides alternatives of biomass processing routes towards an objective of maximizing annualized profit. The formulated model entails five echelons and is implemented on a practical supply chain operational planning case study that involves a biomass-based manufacturing company in southwestern Ontario, Canada intent on long-term business expansion and product portfolio improvement. The results obtained indicates that an optimal product mix comprising a number of products from different processing stages (including preprocessing) can be expected to be achieved, with profit mainly derived through the sales of biofiller, bioethanol, and byproducts.

While a significant research effort has been devoted to biomass production and conversion processes, the importance of logistics was detected more recently. Indeed, efficient supply chains are essential to provide conversion facilities with sufficient quantities of quality biomass at reasonable prices. As large territories and hundreds of biomass producers are involved, quantitative models are very useful to evaluate and optimize the resources required, the associated costs, the energy consumptions and the environmental impacts. This article surveys the recent research on models for biomass supply chains, from an Operations Research perspective. 124 references, including 72 published since 2010, have been analyzed to present the structures and the activities of these chains, a typology of decisions in three levels (strategic, tactical and operational), and a review of models based either on performance evaluation techniques (e.g., simulation) or mathematical optimization.

	abstract = {The present study quantified environmental impacts of the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) value chain in Pakistan for three consecutive years (2015–2018) using a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Energy potential from municipal solid wastes (MSW) was also predicted till the year 2050. Based on a functional unit of 1.0 tonne of MSW, the study analyzed inputs and outputs data through SimaPro v.8.3 applying CML 2000 methodology and cumulative exergy demand indicator (CExD). LCA revealed that operational activities of RWMC mainly contributed to marine aquatic ecotoxicity, i.e. 8962.83 kg1,4-DBeq t−1 MSW, indicating long-range transport of petrogenic hydrocarbons from the company’s fleet gasoline combustion. Similarly, human toxicity potential, global warming potential and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential were also found to be significant, i.e. 18.14 kg1,4-DBeq t−1 MSW, 15.79 kgCO2eq t−1 MSW and 6.22 kg1,4-DBeq t−1 MSW, respectively. The CExD showed that company activities consumed 827.14 MJ t−1 MSW exergy from nature, and gasoline used in MSW transport was the most exergy-intensive process, using 634.47 MJ exergy per tonne MSW disposed of. Projections for energy generation potential up to the year 2050 showed that MSW of Rawalpindi city will have the potential to produce 3901 megawatt of energy to fulfill the energy needs of the country. Possible stratagems to reduce environmental impacts from the municipal solid waste management (MSWM) value chain of RWMC include curtailing dependency on petrogenic and fossil fuels in mobile sources, optimization of waste collection methods and dumping routes, inclining attention toward suitable wastes-to-energy conversion technology and opting for a holistic approach of MSWM in Pakistan. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {A practical approach to deal With the municipal solid Waste at hand needs the adoption of a suitable model and an understanding of the required processes to manage it effectively. A case study of Bhubaneswar City/ Municipal Corporation of Odisha in India, focused on the development of a suitable model based on approaches like Process of elimination, Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat (SwOT) analysis, Mathematical analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process and the Test of sustainability. The study focused on the processes in Municipal Solid Waste (MSw) value chain like Waste generation, primary source storage, collection, secondary storage, transportation, processing and disposal. A two by two matrix model Was adopted to arrive at a suitable disposal model mapped With the source segregation. The Urban Local Body (ULB) analysed Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as one of the criteria to select suitable Collection, Transportation and Disposal Model based on Technical, Economic, Social and Environmental considerations .The mathematical analysis involved Pair-wise Comparison Matrix for the quantitative variables While qualitative variables Were examined by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The economic factor dominated the decision making; ‘street dumping and street sweeping’ got an upper ranking in the final matrix analysis of the collection and Transportation plan and ‘incineration’ dominated the decision making for the disposal plan. The limitation of the study showed that the application of mathematical model to find out optimum Municipal Solid Waste (MSw) Model does not accommodate qualitative variables. Therefore, SwOT analysis and sustainability studies Were examined to arrive at the best possible model. SwOT criteria dreW upon the Work environment With respect to financial position of the Urban Local Body, Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor, Private Public Partnership (PPP) mode aspirants, availability of mature technology and threat in factors like adverse regulatory order, disruptive technologies and the lack of political Will. The test of sustainability based on the proposed model passed through the test of capability and constraint study, social acceptance, regulatory compliance, and ground level feasibility. Based on multiple criteria in decision making, the study found that ideally Bhubaneswar should adopt a model Where source segregation With door to door collection of Waste facility is given top priority. Decentralization of Waste disposal and cluster approach of cities and towns nearby to curb the Waste menace and facilitate the Waste to go the fuel Way looked sustainable and achievable. At the same time, addressing the Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor by earmarking land bank for Waste disposal and collection of cesses from the city inhabitants could generate enough financial resources for its sustainability. This research unbolts discussions With respect to the challenges presented by the Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor, finding suitable landfill sites for solid Waste disposal, interference of disruptive technologies and the change in leadership not owning up to responsibilities or revoking the previously established management practices. Sustainability studies should help all stakeholders to participate harmoniously With a common goal of clean city and striving for a better planet. Similarly, the comparative matrix based on the scientific, financial, social and ecological considerations Were applied to the disposal plan to develop a fitting model for the Urban Local Body (ULB). The study ascertained that Bhubaneswar should have source segregation With door to door collection facility and may need decentralized composting facility centres to handle the biodegradable Wastes. The plastic Wastes may be used for Waste to Fuel or for road making. The non-degradable may go to land fill or Waste to Energy plant With cluster approach combining nearby Cuttack and Khurdha districts to meet the Waste requirement of 550 tonnes per day to sustain the plant. At the same time, it should collect cess from the city habitants to generate enough financial resources for sustainability. It should earmark the land-bank for Waste processing facilities as it faces serious law and Order problems due to Not in my backyard (NIMBY) factor. © 2020 by ASERS® Publishing.

	abstract = {Abstract: Bioenergy is expected to play an important role in the future mix of energy supply in bridging the gap between diminishing fossil fuels and increasing global energy needs, as it is in contrast to other renewable energies, capable of providing base-load capacities. Valorization of biomass as a source of energy is challenging due to the large variety of biomass feedstocks and conversion technologies. To master these challenges and to establish a successful bioenergy market, the development of optimized biomass value chains is essential. We present a case study application of a biomass value chain design for the tri-national Upper Rhine Region. A mathematical model is formulated, which uses existing potentials in order to optimize the biomass value chain in terms of multiple feedstocks, technologies, and outputs. Potential biomass conversion plants are identified or existing ones are upgraded while integrating transportation, location, technology, and capacity planning. The model is implemented and applied in a case study for the Upper Rhine Region. The resulting insights provide for a techno-economic assessment of biomass value chains and the identification of potential biomass pathways. In this way, support is provided in strategic decision making, while taking into account the type of biomass feedstock as well as the conversion technology, and in tactical planning by allocating feedstock to conversion facility locations. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Straw recycling has generated high collection and transportation costs. Scientifically informed collection, storage, and transportation methods can reduce automobile exhaust emissions and high transportation costs. According to the relevant statistics, China’s total theoretical straw resources reached 920 million tons in 2020. Due to such regional and seasonal straw surpluses, however, comprehensive utilization technologies need to be improved, and farmers’ awareness of environmental protection needs to be strengthened. In some areas, open burning of straw is still practiced, causing environmental pollution and wasting resources. This study used cost and carbon emission metrics in a dual-objective planning model to plan the site selection of straw collection and storage facilities. Compared with the current manual calculation in various links in straw supply logistics, modeling can resolve the contradiction between cost and carbon emission considerations and can help meet the goal of Pareto optimum while ensuring supply, reducing costs for enterprises, and providing decision-making assistance for the government. This paper uses transportation theory and a dual-objective, mixed-integer model to study the field of biomass energy. Through the planning and design of the biomass raw material supply chain, the system efficiency is improved, and the studied company can obtain more profits. This article also explores the role of controlling carbon emissions in the field of biomass energy. It is believed that the government not only needs to guide corporate decision-making by charging carbon taxes but also needs to support enterprises in participating in the field of biomass power generation through active policy guidance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In many urbanized areas the roadside and nature conservation management offers a biomass-for-bioenergy resource potential which is barely valorized, because of the fragmented biomass production sites and the scarcity of accurate data on the spatial availability of the biomass. In this study, a GIS based assessment was performed to determine the regional non-woody biomass-for-bioenergy potential for biogas from conservation areas and roadsides in Flanders, Belgium. These systems, with an area of 31,055. ha, have an annual herbaceous biomass production of 203. kton dry matter. The full associated biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain was optimized in four scenarios to maximize the net energy output and the profit. The scenario analysis was performed with OPTIMASS, a recently developed GIS based strategic decision support system. The analysis showed that the energetic valorization of conservation and roadside biomass through anaerobic digestion had a positive net energy balance, although there is still much room for improvements. Economically, however, it is a less interesting biomass resource. Most likely, the economic picture would change when other ecosystem services delivered by the protected biodiversity would be taken into account. Future technical advances and governmental incentives, like green energy certificates, will be necessary to incorporate the biomass into the energy chain. By tackling the existing barriers and providing a detailed methodology for biomass potential assessments, this study tries to facilitate the valorization of conservation and roadside biomass in order to reconcile biodiversity and road safety goals with renewable energy targets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

To handle different types of uncertainty, including randomness, epistemic and deep uncertainties, a hybrid robust optimization model is proposed. Uncertainty in technology is presented as imprecise conversion rates, which are expressed as probabilistic scenarios. Biomass yield is treated as fuzzy numbers while demand is assumed to vary in a known interval. Furthermore, fixed costs of the biorefineries are calculated according to the piecewise linear functions in which segments are capacity level intervals. In order to investigate the performance of the proposed models a case study is developed for bioethanol supply chain located in Iran.

	abstract = {Biomass-based biofuels have gained attention because they are renewable energy sources that could facilitate energy independence and improve rural economic development. As biomass supply and biofuel demand areas are generally not geographically contiguous, the design of an efficient and effective biomass supply chain from biomass provision to biofuel distribution is critical to facilitate large-scale biofuel development. This study compared the costs of supplying biomass using three alternative biomass preprocessing and densification technologies (pelletizing, briquetting, and grinding) and two alternative transportation modes (trucking and rail) for the design of a four-stage biomass-biofuel supply chain in which biomass produced in Illinois is used to meet biofuel demands in either California or Illinois. The BioScope optimization model was applied to evaluate a four-stage biomass-biofuel supply chain that includes biomass supply, centralized storage and preprocessing (CSP), biorefinery, and ethanol distribution. We examined the cost of 15 scenarios that included a combination of three biomass preprocessing technologies and five supply chain configurations. The findings suggested that the transportation costs for biomass would generally follow the pattern of coal transportation. Converting biomass to ethanol locally and shipping ethanol over long distances is most economical, similar to the existing grain-based biofuel system. For the Illinois-California supply chain, moving ethanol is $0.24 gal-1 less costly than moving biomass even in densified form over long distances. The use of biomass pellets leads to lower overall costs of biofuel production for long-distance transportation but to higher costs if used for short-distance movement due to its high capital and processing costs. Supported by the supply chain optimization modeling, the cellulosic-ethanol production and distribution costs of using Illinois feedstock to meet California demand are $0.08 gal-1 higher than that for meeting local Illinois demand. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Monod and Logistic growth models have been widely used as basic equations to describe cell growth in bioprocess engineering. In the case of the Monod equation, the specific growth rate is governed by a limiting nutrient, with the mathematical form similar to the Michaelis–Menten equation. In the case of the Logistic equation, the specific growth rate is determined by the carrying capacity of the system, which could be growth-inhibiting factors (i.e., toxic chemical accumulation) other than the nutrient level. Both equations have been found valuable to guide us build unstructured kinetic models to analyze the fermentation process and understand cell physiology. In this work, we present a hybrid Logistic-Monod growth model, which accounts for multiple growth-dependent factors including both the limiting nutrient and the carrying capacity of the system. Coupled with substrate consumption and yield coefficient, we present the analytical solutions for this hybrid Logistic-Monod model in both batch and continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) culture. Under high biomass yield (Yx/s) conditions, the analytical solution for this hybrid model is approaching to the Logistic equation; under low biomass yield condition, the analytical solution for this hybrid model converges to the Monod equation. This hybrid Logistic-Monod equation represents the cell growth transition from substrate-limiting condition to growth-inhibiting condition, which could be adopted to accurately describe the multi-phases of cell growth and may facilitate kinetic model construction, bioprocess optimization, and scale-up in industrial biotechnology. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Due to the rising concerns on climate issues, the transitions of fossil fuels to renewable energy are highly promoted globally. Malaysia which has abundant sources of biomass, is maximising the efforts to increase renewable energy shares in the current energy mix. Biomass co-firing with coal offers a promising route to less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the zero net greenhouse effect of biomass combustion. This paper presents an integrated spatial optimisation model of biomass co-firing supply chain for existing power generation facilities through the integration of geographical information system (GIS) and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model integrates spatial distributions of biomass supply, locations to build biomass pre-treatment facilities, location-allocation of supply and demand of biomass co-firing supply chain and economic and environmental sounds of biomass co-firing system. The optimisation of the whole supply chain system is conducted with the aim to minimise the overall cost and its emissions while determining the most optimal locations to build pre-treatment facilities to support co-firing power generation. Based on the findings, the cost factors of deploying co-firing technology in existing coal-fired power plant are between 56.61 and 61.65 USD/MWh for 10–50% co-firing rates as compared to the base case electricity generation cost which is at 56.29 USD/MWh. Minimum differences in cost factors are achieved when dedicated fossil fuels scenario is compared to several co-firing scenarios. Up to 8.83 × 106 t of CO2 (equivalent to 46% of CO2 reduction) can be reduced annually in Johor as a result of this practice. This shows that co-firing technology is promising to be implemented in Malaysia while achieving significant emissions reduction target with incentives supported by government. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bismil district of Diyarbakir (Turkey) is a region where agricultural activities are very common. About 60% of the terrain is irrigable. Cotton and corn are mostly grown in these irrigable lands. Given the bioenergy incentive provided by the Republic of Turkey and the extensiveness of agricultural lands in Turkey, energy production from cotton and corn residues in the tri-generation facility through gasification conversion technology seems like a quite profitable investment. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming model, which optimizes the numbers, locations, and capacities of the tri-generation facility/s, was developed and empirically solved. The model tries to maximize the net present value of the potential investment by comparing the trade-offs between the raw material/end-product transportation costs, facility/s, and pipeline installation costs. Electricity and heating/cooling energy were sold to the government and settlements through the closest interconnected lines and pipelines, respectively. In this study, electricity, the heating/cooling energy and the fertilizer (biochar) sale were considered for the calculation of annual revenue, while transportation of raw materials and heating/cooling energy, losses during heat transfer and electricity transmission, operation and maintenance costs of facilities and pipelines were considered for the calculation of annual expenses. Initial investment cost includes facility, pipeline, and electricity transmission installation costs. The model proposes one facility with an installed power of approximately 35 MW which met cooling energy demand of 3 settlements, both cooling and heat energy demand of 2 settlements. The net present value of the investment is almost 338 million EUR and the repayment period is 1.3 years. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Electric cars and biofuel fed vehicles may contribute to tackle this formidable issue. According to this perspective, a multi-echelon supply chain is here investigated considering biomass cultivation, transport, conversion into bioethanol or bioelectricity, distribution, and final usage in alternative bifuel (ethanol and petrol) and electric vehicles. Multiperiod and spatially explicit features are introduced in a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) modelling framework where economic (in terms of Net Present Value) and environmental (in terms of Greenhouse Gases emissions) objectives are simultaneously taken into account. The first and second generation bioethanol production supply chain is matched with a biopower production supply chain assessing multiple technologies. Both corn grain and stover are considered as biomass sources. In the environmental analysis, the impact on emissions caused by indirect Land Use Change (iLUC) effects is also assessed. Results will show the efficacy of the methodology at providing stakeholders with a quantitative tool to optimise the economic and environmental performance of different supply chain configurations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recently, to obtain biogas from biomass, an innovative system based on both sustainable intensification of crop rotation and use of by-products was developed. This system derives from BIOGASDONERIGHT concept, which was put forward with the aim of making more sustainable biogas production. Among the by-products that could be considered for the anaerobic digestion within this new concept, olive pomace (OP) has been the object of research studies aimed at evaluating its possible reuse for energy purpose in terms of economic sustainability. This possibility is of relevant importance to reduce the environmental burden caused by disposal processes of the residues of olive oil industries. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the amount of processed olives in olive-producing areas, as well as the correct planning of OP use for energy purposes, has not yet been the object of research activities. Therefore, the aim of this research study was to compute the availability of OP, the main waste from the olive oil industry to be disposed of, by following a methodology which included a geographic information system (GIS) based model that allowed the computation of indicators suitable to describe OP potential production within geographical areas. In the first phase of the study, the spatial distribution of the olive-producing areas in Sicily, a geographical area of the Mediterranean Basin highly representative of olive oil production, was analyzed. Then, a GIS-based model, previously defined and applied to evaluate the amount of citrus pulp production, was applied to this case study to estimate OP potential production by the computation of a suitable index. The model required information about olive oil industries, which was gathered by performing specific surveys, and included the computation of indicators regarding olive-producing areas, the amount of olive oil produced, and the amount of OP obtained. In the second phase of this study, the quantification of OP that can be available for biogas production was carried out at a provincial level in an area described by the highest potential of OP production. The total amount of OP available for biogas production corresponded theoretically to 1.9 million Nm3 biogas. This result proved that OP has a high potential to be converted into a resource for renewable energy production, such as biogas. Therefore, it constituted a potential solution to issues related to the environmental burden of OP disposal. Furthermore, the GIS-based model applied in this case study, by giving the potential production of OP, could contribute to build an information base aimed at improving the sustainability of biogas sector. In this context, by considering the availability and distribution of other agricultural biomasses, the results of this study could be useful for applications in geographical areas where biogas sector is still developing. In fact, the obtained results could help identifying the best location of new biogas plants in terms of optimization of the logistics of biomasses supply. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {Operational inefficiencies due to wide variability in physical and compositional attributes characteristic of existing corn stover supply systems threaten the development of a sustainable bioeconomy. We utilized discrete event simulation to conduct stochastic feedstock property-dependent throughput analysis of a conventional corn stover supply logistics-preprocessing-conversion system. Pilot scale preprocessing equipment data and experiential information were used to inform failure frequency and down time. A new metric was introduced, "overall operating effectiveness"(OOE), which over a specified time period dynamically assesses the composite impacts of feedstock quality on the operational efficiency and productivity of the individual subsystems of the biomass to biofuel supply chain. For a 55% minimum carbohydrate specification at the entrance to conversion, the modeled OOE values for the supply logistics, preprocessing, and conversion subsystems were 56.9%, 24.4%, and 101%, respectively. The severity of throughput impacts depended primarily on moisture, while performance impacts depended on the range of corn stover compositional variability. Costs varied significantly as a function of assumed minimum acceptable carbohydrate contents from 45 to 59 wt % (proxy for conversion robustness), with a mean feedstock cost of $249.93/dry Mg (median of $146.39/dry Mg) for a 55% minimum carbohydrate content. As the floor was relaxed from an nth-plant specification of 59%, a higher proportion of the preprocessed feedstock was fed to conversion leading to feedstock contributions to biofuel costs ranging from $4.15 to $8.73/gge (2016$). We conclude that while conversion robustness can serve to minimize discarded feedstock, properties other than yield potential are more significant contributors to the feedstock contribution to biofuel cost.

	abstract = {Given the need to shift away from fossil fuels, expanding the role of the bioeconomy is vitally important. Biomass supply chain optimisation is a tool that has been used to help the biomass industry gain a foothold. Biomass supply chain models frequently use the average biomass yield of large areas to calculate overall yield. However, there can be large variation in the biomass yield within those areas, losing useful information. A biomass supply chain optimisation framework has been developed which uses information about the quality of land available by incorporating piecewise linear approximation of the biomass yield distribution into the optimisation. Linear approximations of the biomass yield variability allows the supply chain optimisation model to make more accurate decisions about quantity and location of biomass growth operations, affecting all downstream decisions. A case study of southwest Hungary for potential biomass industry viability has been examined using the framework to illustrate the impact of this yield information in the optimisation. The proposed framework successfully optimised the supply chain while accounting for variability in a spatially distributed resource, found that using the biomass yield estimates reduced the overall land usage by up to 17% in some cases, and improved biomass production by over 7%. Further, it improved biomass output, increasing the quantity of bioproducts which can be produced, and increasing the financial performance, thus demonstrating the importance of including yield variability in the optimisation. This framework could be used for other spatially distributed resources, such as solar insolation or wind availability. © 2019},

	abstract = {Biofuel, an efficient alternative to fossil fuels, has gained considerable attention as a potential source to satisfy energy demands. Biomass collection and distribution typically incur a significant portion of the biofuel production cost. Thus, it is imperative to design a biofuel supply chain network that not only aims to minimize the delivery cost, but also incorporates biomass quality properties that make this raw material so unique yet challenging. This article proposes a novel two-stage stochastic programming model that captures different time- and weather-dependent biomass quality parameters (e.g., the moisture content, ash content, and dry matter loss) and their impact on the overall supply chain design. To efficiently solve this optimization model, we propose a parallelized hybrid decomposition algorithm that combines the sample average approximation with an enhanced progressive hedging algorithm. The proposed mathematical model and solutions are validated with a real-life case study. The numerical experiments reveal that the biomass quality variability impacts the supply chain design by requiring additional depots, and therefore, it increases the capital investment. The storage of unprocessed biomass at depots and biorefineries decreased by 88.5% and 97.9%, respectively, and the densified biomass inventory at biorefineries increased 17-fold when baseline quality considerations were taken into account. © Copyright © 2020 “IISE”.},

	abstract = {Even though a shift from conventional to renewable resources is often envisaged, lignocellulosic biorefinery concepts struggle with economic viability and sustainability. In order to overcome these barriers, a full analysis from biomass supply chain, process performance optimization, and product-portfolio selection is targeted. Addressing the economic viability and sustainability already at an early process development stage when only limited knowledge is available, Process Network Flux Analysis (PNFA) [Ulonska et al., AIChE J. 2017, 62, 3096-3108] is capable of systematically identifying the most valuable processing pathways. This enables a first performance ranking based on the profit or global warming potential of pathways, thereby accelerating process development. While so far only processing networks have been considered, the methodology is herein extended to consider biomass supply chain optimization and market-dependent price developments such that all main influencing factors are considered simultaneously. The extended methodology is validated identifying reasonable plant locations in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Enhancing economic viability of the best performing biofuel ethanol, a multiproduct biorefinery is targeted coproducing value-added chemicals. Herein, a coproduction of iso-butanol raises the profit significantly: a mass ratio of at most 1.9 (ethanol:iso-butanol) is required to break even. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Compliance with long term climate targets whilst maintaining energy security is understood to rely heavily on the large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs). One option, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), is prominent in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), with projected annual contributions of 8-16.5 GtCO per year of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal whilst contributing 150-300 EJ per year, or 14 to 20% of global primary energy supply, in 2100. Implicit in these scenarios is the assumption that BECCS is a net producer of energy. However, relatively energy intensive biomass supply chains and low power generation efficiency could challenge this ubiquitous assumption. Deploying an energy negative technology at this scale could thus represent a threat to energy security. In this contribution, we evaluate the energy return on investment (EROI) of an archetypal BECCS facility. In order to highlight the importance of biomass sourcing, two feedstock scenarios are considered: use of domestic biomass pellets (UK) and import of biomass pellets from Louisiana, USA. We use the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework to explicitly account for growing, pre-treating, transporting and converting the feedstock in a 500 MW BECCS facility. As an example, we illustrate how the net electricity balance (NElB) of a UK-based BECCS facility can be either positive or negative, as a function of supply chain decisions. Power plant efficiency, fuel efficiency for transport, transport distance, moisture content, drying method, as well as yield were identified as key factors that need to be carefully managed to maximise BECCS net electricity balance. A key insight of this contribution is that, given an annual carbon removal target, increasing BECCS' power generation efficiency by using a more advanced biomass conversion and CO2 capture technology could improve BECCS net electricity balance, but at the cost of increasing the amount of BECCS capacity required to meet this target. BECCS optimal deployment pathway is thus heavily dependent on which service provided by BECCS is most valued: carbon dioxide removal or power generation. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Sustainability concerns emphasise the importance of identifying eco-efficient supply chain configurations which balance economic and environmental chain objectives. The applied modelling approaches for this purpose often assume the availability of raw materials and full coordination within the supply chain studied. Some or all actors in the chain can however pursue individual objectives, making the obtained solutions unfeasible in practice. Economic incentives support aligning the objectives of the different supply chain actors. This paper explores the design of eco-efficient biomass supply chains and economic gain allocation between the supply chain partners. A case study is developed for the sugar beet processing chain in the Netherlands, in which farmers can also choose to produce other competing crops. We observe that higher yields often lead to lower carbon emissions per ton of produce. Hence, eco-efficient solutions are found to have production and processing locations in the most productive regions. Additionally, margin sharing above the minimum sugar beet price is necessary to ensure the production of the desired quantity of sugar beet. Realistic sugar beet prices are determined using a Shapley-value approach, leading to a fair distribution of margin among the farmers and processor in the supply chain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Under EU Renewable energy targets, Ireland must achieve contributions of 40%, 12% and 10% from renewables to electricity, heat and transport respectively by 2020, in addition to a 20% reduction in GHG emissions. Life cycle assessment methodology was used to carry out a comprehensive, holistic evaluation of biomass-to-energy systems in 2020 based on indigenous biomass supply chains optimised to reduce production and transportation GHG emissions. Impact categories assessed include; global warming, acidification, eutrophication potentials, and energy demand. Two biomass energy conversion technologies are considered; co-firing with peat, and biomass CHP (combined heat and power) systems. Biomass is allocated to each plant according to a supply optimisation model which ensures minimal GHG emissions. The study shows that while CHP systems produce lower environmental impacts than co-firing systems in isolation, determining overall environmental impacts requires analysis of the reference energy systems which are displaced. In addition, if the aims of these systems are to increase renewable energy penetration in line with the renewable electricity and renewable heat targets, the optimal scenario may not be the one which achieves the greatest environmental impact reductions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Currently, the commercialization of cellulosic biofuel is proceeding at a slower pace than expected due to the high cost of the cellulosic biofuel supply chain (CBSC), especially in the manufacturing process. In this paper, a new model for a four-echelon CBSC incorporating 12 conversion pathways is proposed to minimize total supply chain cost by considering multiple time periods, various biomass types and spatial distributions, biomass and biofuel inventories, logistics, and different demand levels. Case studies from the state of Illinois in the U.S. are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is manifested that the model can select appropriate conversion pathways for biorefineries given the abundance of local resources to minimize the overall cost. Compared to the two cases adopted a single conversion pathway, the optimal result achieves 14.6% and 4.6% reductions on the unit biofuel cost, respectively. In addition, the results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the biorefinery construction cost and the biofuel throughput are the main economic drivers in the current supply chain design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article presents an analysis of transportable biomass conversion facilities to evaluate the conceptual and economic viability of a highly mobile and modular biomass conversion supply chain in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The goal of this work is to support a broader effort to more effectively and sustainably use residual biomass from commercial harvesting operations that are currently piled and burned as part of site preparation. A structural representation is first developed to include sources of biomass feedstock, distributed preprocessing hubs (centralized landings), and centralized processing facilities (biomass to product conversion sites) to produce desired products and byproducts. A facility costing model was developed to evaluate potential economics of scale, which then informed the optimization study. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to characterize, evaluate, and optimize biomass collection, extraction, logistics, and facility placement over a regional landscape from a strategic level to evaluate the mobility concept. The objective was to minimize supply chain operational costs in order to quantify financial advantages and identify challenges of the proposed system modularity and mobility. A Lakeview, Oregon case study was evaluated with an assumed modular biochar facility servicing the region. In particular, we review economies of scale, mobility, energy costs, and biomass availability tradeoffs. This analysis points towards a modular system design of movement frequency between 1 to 2 years being most viable in the conditions evaluated. It was found that the impact of plant movement, scale, and biomass availability can increase supply chain costs by $11/BDMT ($10/BDT), $33/BDMT ($30/BDT), and $22/BDMT ($20/BDT) above the base case cost of $182/BDMT ($165/BDT) for a large-scale facility [45,000 BDMT yr-1(50,000 BDT yr-1)]in the conditions evaluated. Additionally, potential energy cost savings of a non-mobile modular stationary site as compared to one which utilizes off-grid electrical powers about $11/BDMT ($10/BDT) for a biochar facility. From the cases evaluated, a large-scale plant with limited mobility would be preferred under low availability of biomass conditions, whereas a stationary grid-connected plant would be more cost effective under higher availability conditions. Results depend greatly on the region, assumed harvest schedule, biomass composition, and governing biomass plant assumptions. © 2018 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},

	abstract = {Utilization of forest and wood residues to produce bioenergy and biofuels could generate additional revenue streams for forestry companies, reduce their environmental impacts and generate new development opportunities for forest-dependent communities. Further development of forest-based biorefineries entails addressing complexities and challenges related to biomass procurement, logistics, technologies, and sustainability. Numerous optimization models have been proposed for the economic and environmental design of biomass-to-bioenergy or biofuel supply chains. A few of them also maximized the job creation potential of the supply chain through the use of employment multipliers. The use of a total job creation indicator as the social optimization objective implies that all new jobs generate the same level of social benefit. In this paper, we quantify the potential social benefit of new forest-based biorefinery supply chains considering different impacts of new jobs based on their type and location. This social benefit is incorporated into a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model that maximizes the social benefit, net present value and greenhouse gas emission saving potential of a forest-based biorefinery supply chain. The applicability of the model is illustrated through a case study in the interior region of British Columbia, Canada where different utilization paths for available forest and wood residues are investigated. The multi-objective optimization model is solved using a Pareto-generating method. The analysis of the generated set of Pareto-optimal solutions show a trade-off between the net present value of the supply chain and the other two investigated objectives. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between the potential to generate high impact jobs in the region and its potential to generate greenhouse gas emission savings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study proposes a reverse logistics network involved in the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) to solve the challenge of economically managing these wastes considering the recent legal requirements of the Brazilian Waste Management Policy. The feasibility of the allocation of MSW material recovery facilities (MRF) as intermediate points between the generators of these wastes and the options for reuse and disposal was evaluated, as well as the participation of associations and cooperatives of waste pickers. This network was mathematically modelled and validated through a scenario analysis of the municipality of São Mateus, which makes the location model more complete and applicable in practice. The mathematical model allows the determination of the number of facilities required for the reverse logistics network, their location, capacities, and product flows between these facilities. The fixed costs of installation and operation of the proposed MRF were balanced with the reduction of transport costs, allowing the inclusion of waste pickers to the reverse logistics network. The main contribution of this study lies in the proposition of a reverse logistics network for MSW simultaneously involving legal, environmental, economic and social criteria, which is a very complex goal. This study can guide practices in other countries that have realities similar to those in Brazil of accelerated urbanisation without adequate planning for solid waste management, added to the strong presence of waste pickers that, through the characteristic of social vulnerability, must be included in the system. In addition to the theoretical contribution to the reverse logistics network problem, this study aids in decision-making for public managers who have limited technical and administrative capacities for the management of solid wastes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to provide resiliency against existing epistemic uncertainties and disruption risks in the supply chain, a hybrid robust stochastic-possibilistic programming approach is employed. The proposed model minimizes total expected cost of the supply chain over non-disruption and disruption scenarios while limiting greenhouse gas emissions for sustainability considerations. The model determines the optimal supply chain strategic and tactical decision variables such as location, capacity and technology of biorefineries, transportation modes, shipments, inventory levels and production and import amounts. The performance of the model is evaluated through a real case study developed in Iran. Comparing the proposed resilient model with its non-resilient counterpart reveals that the proposed model is superior both in cost and GHG emissions reductions.

	abstract = {The human dependency on finite fossil fuel has led to its drastic depletion. Along with its detrimental effects on the environment, such practice is now deemed unsustainable. This phenomenon has led to the growth for utilisation of biomass in the production of biofuels, biochemical and other related bioproducts. This waste-to-wealth strategy is no doubt highly beneficial to the society. However, the major challenge in the commercialisation of bioproducts production includes the complex conversion processes and the uncertainty in the supply and sources of biomass. Therefore, efficient supply chain management and optimisation is essential to overcome these barriers and variables that may constrain the development of a competitive and sustainable bioproducts market. This overview provides an extensional definition of biomass-to-bioproducts supply chain and systematically describes the problems and decisions along this chain. It also identifies the characteristics of a sustainable integrated biomass supply chain, and finally presents an overview of biomass supply chain synthesis and optimisation methods. Based on the existing research gap, the key challenges and potential future works are highlighted. This paper will provide readers with an initial point to understand the concept of sustainable biomass supply chain management and the synthesis and optimisation of sustainable biomass supply chain models. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper reviews the literature for modeling and optimization studies of lignocellulosic biomass supply chains with densification processes. Research studies in academic journals, books, and trade publications are classified based on four criteria: biomass type, densification form, analytical methodology, and densification machines’ mobility. We find that baling is the most-studied densification technique, while optimization modeling is the most common analysis method. Although pelleting and pyrolysis achieve a higher density than baling, comparatively few studies have examined their role in the overall supply chain. We identify future research opportunities, the most significant of which are integrating mobile densification and introducing comprehensive biomass-to-biofuel supply chain optimization models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This method can relieve the food versus fuel competition due to the use of edible matter of crop in first-generation biofuel production. It can also boost the low ethanol concentration and thus reduce the unit production cost when using cellulosic biomass as well as green the energy footprints when preprocessing cellulosic biomass in second-generation biofuel production. In this paper, we examine the economic performance and environmental footprint of the biofuel supply chain using co-fermentation production technology. The cost and greenhouse gas emissions per unit bioethanol produced are quantified and compared to the performances of first- and second-generation biofuel production technologies. The mathematical models for the biofuel supply chain using three different biomass types are proposed. A numerical case study based on the State of Missouri in the United States is implemented. The results of the case study show that a co-fermentation based supply chain can effectively address the concern of food versus fuel competition of corn sourced supply chain and the issues of low sugar yield, high energy footprints, and high unit cost of corn stover sourced supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the promising industry faces financial deficits because of difficulties in collecting straw from farmers. To determine strategies for overcoming the biomass supply problem, we apply Stackelberg game theory in modeling the Chinese biomass supply chain and design incentive scenarios under stakeholder risk perception. We illustrate the proposed methodology through an empirical case study on China and demonstrate the effects of incentives on farmers and middlemen. Results show that with incentives, straw quantity and stakeholder profit are expected to increase. Incentives exert a particularly remarkable effect on farmers, with such inducements producing the highest social welfare. Moreover, perceived risk dramatically affects stakeholder profit. Mitigating the risk perception of farmers is expected to significantly advance the development of the biomass power generation industry, increase stakeholder profit, and decrease the amount of incentives needed. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

	abstract = {A critical factor in producing economically viable and environmentally sustainable biomass to biofuels supply chains is a strategic biorefinery location. Sustainable biorefinery location is characterized by replacing fossil fuel with biofuels, enhancing cost-effectiveness, environmental issues mitigation, and stimulating socio-economic growth. The optimal biorefinery location selection depends on trade-offs between five different parameters: Feedstock availability, distance, social measures, cost, and emissions. This paper aims to incorporate qualitative criteria and quantitative criteria using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in selecting the optimal biorefinery location. The model renders the AHP model to prioritize the optimal biorefinery location with the minimum cost and lower environmental impacts. Sensitivity analysis with continuous criteria weight at 20 % changes is performed to check the robustness of the optimal solution obtained from the AHP optimization model. A case study in Johor, Southern Malaysia, is adopted for this research assessment. Optimal biorefinery location at minimal cost and the lowest emissions is identified using Expert Choice v.11.5. The results indicate that the proposed AHP and sensitivity analysis decision-making model could be robustly used to select biorefinery locations with specified criteria. Conclusively, the systematic methodology presented can help facility planning authorities formulate viable location strategies for a biorefinery in volatile and complex global decision environments.  © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

	abstract = {Policy and industry decision makers place high priority on the contribution of biomass to the emerging low carbon, circular economy. Optimisation of performance, from the perspectives of environmental, social and economic sustainability and resource efficiency, is essential to successful development and operation of biomass value chains. The complexity of value chains, which comprise interrelated stages from land use to conversion and multiple end products, presents challenges. To date, decision makers have approached from the viewpoints of single market sectors or issues, such as market shares of bioeconomy and reduction of carbon emissions to mitigate climate change. This approach does not achieve a full understanding of value chains and their competitive priorities, limits consumer awareness, and poses risks of sub-optimal performance and under-development of potential local capacity. This paper presents a conceptual framework that combines value chain analysis and competitive priority theory with indicators suitable to measure, monitor and interpret sustainability and resource efficiency at value chain level. The case of biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is used to illustrate how optimisation strategies can be focused to address challenges in value chain stages which will lead to better performance and uptake of sustainably sourced, widely accepted biomass options. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The depletion of fossil fuels and their serious environmental concerns have made renewable energy sources much more attractive. One of the more promising renewable energy alternatives is the use of second/third-generation biomass that does not endanger food security, to produce bioenergy. The biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain design is a challenging issue that has attracted the attention of academic and industrial research. In this direction, a multi-objective multi-period MILP model is developed to design the second/third-generation biofuel supply chain using anaerobic digestion and transesterification processes. Three types of biomass (i.e. agricultural residues and livestock manure, microalgae and Jatropha) simultaneously are studied as feedstock to produce clean energy in all climatic and geographic conditions, and even in remote areas. Selection of raw material resources, location of production facilities, location of warehouses, and optimal material flows are the main decisions made by the proposed model to minimize the total cost and maximize the produced energy. The performance of this model is evaluated and validated through conducting a real case study. The results show that considering the amount of produced bioenergy regardless to its type, energy production from microalgae and Jatropha is more viable than bio-wastes. The results also show that production cost (especially biodiesel production cost from Jatropha) and investment cost (especially construction costs of microalgae and Jatropha to biodiesel production sites) have the most effect on the total cost of the supply chain network, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents a MCO (multi-criteria optimisation) of regional biomass supply chains for the conversion of biomass to energy through the simultaneous maximisation of economic performance and minimisation of the environmental and social FPs (footprints). The energy supply-chain model contains agricultural, pre-processing, processing, and distribution layers. An integrated model, previously developed by the authors, for regional biomass energy network optimisation is used as a basis, and now extended for simultaneous assessment of the supply-chain performance based on LCA (Life cycle assessment). Several total FPs are introduced for " cradle" to " grave" evaluation, which, besides direct, comprises also indirect effects caused by products' substitutions. In the MCO approach, the annual profit is maximised against each FP generating different sets of Pareto optimal solutions, one for each FP. With this approach the aggregation of different environmental and/or social pressures is thus avoided. The results indicate that total FPs enable the obtaining of more realistic solutions, than in those cases when only direct FPs are considered. More profitable and less environmentally harmful solutions can be gained with significant reduction in total carbon and total energy FPs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This technology was studied, grant financed and applied on the first time in Romania through this project. Nevertheless, there is a recent trend to integrate economic, environmental and social aspects in the assessment and optimisation of biomass supply chains. The conclusion is that biomass brings significant contributions to sustainable development, at least due to the following aspects: protects natural anthropic resources, contribute to environmental protection by neutralizing many organic materials, stimulate works and creating new jobs, farmers boosting in diversifying agricultural production in terms of biomass production.},

	abstract = {Finland considers energy production from woody biomass as an efficient energy planning strategy to increase the domestic renewable energy production in order to substitute fossil fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a number of developmental activities are implemented in the country, and one of them is the installation of second generation liquid biofuel demonstration plants. In this study, two gasification-based biomass conversion technologies, methanol and combined heat and power (CHP) production, are assessed for commercialization. Spatial information on forest resources, sawmill residues, existing biomass-based industries, energy demand regions, possible plant locations, and a transport network of Eastern Finland is fed into a geographically explicit Mixed Integer Programming model to minimize the costs of the entire supply chain which includes the biomass supply, biomass and biofuel transportation, biomass conversion, energy distribution, and emissions. The model generates a solution by determining the optimal number, locations, and technology mix of bioenergy production plants. Scenarios were created with a focus on biomass and energy demand, plant characteristics, and cost variations. The model results state that the biomass supply and high energy demand are found to have a profound influence on the potential bioenergy production plant locations. The results show that methanol can be produced in Eastern Finland under current market conditions at an average cost of 0.22 €/l with heat sales (0.34 €/l without heat sales). The introduction of energy policy tools, like cost for carbon, showed a significant influence on the choice of technology and CO 2 emission reductions. The results revealed that the methanol technology was preferred over the CHP technology at higher carbon dioxide cost (>145 €/t CO2). The results indicate that two methanol plants (360 MW biomass) are needed to be built to meet the transport fuel demand of Eastern Finland. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Throughout the recent years minimizing driving times has been the main focus of optimizations in this field. In addition to this aim the objective of reducing environmental impacts, represented by carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) emissions, is discussed. The underlying problem is formulated as a multi-depot vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery and time windows (MDVRPPDTW) and a new iterative solution method is proposed. For the numerical studies, real-life data are used to generate test instances of different scales concerning the supply chain of biomass power plants. Small ones are taken to validate the optimality of the new approach. Medium and large test instances are solved with respect to minimizing driving times and fuel consumptions separately. This study shows that the selection of the objective of minimizing fuel consumption leads to a significant reduction of CO2 e emissions compared to a minimization of driving times. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major problem particularly for large urban areas with insufficient landfill capacities and inefficient waste management systems. Several options associated to the supply chain for implementing a MSW management system are available, however to determine the optimal solution several technical, economic, environmental and social aspects must be considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a mathematical programming model for the optimal planning of the supply chain associated to the MSW management system to maximize the economic benefit while accounting for technical and environmental issues. The optimization model simultaneously selects the processing technologies and their location, the distribution of wastes from cities as well as the distribution of products to markets. The problem was formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programing problem to maximize the profit of the supply chain and the amount of recycled wastes, where the results are showed through Pareto curves that tradeoff economic and environmental aspects. The proposed approach is applied to a case study for the west-central part of Mexico to consider the integration of MSW from several cities to yield useful products. The results show that an integrated utilization of MSW can provide economic, environmental and social benefits. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The pressure on reducing environmental footprint is facilitating the emergence of energy supply chains that have biomass as main feedstock. For the development of efficient energy supply chains from biomass it is required to properly integrate the various elements that comprise such systems (e.g., biomass supply, pre-treatment facilities and technologies for biomass to energy and/or fuels conversion). Additionally, it is recognised that a concerted effort is required, embracing the different supply chain entities, in order to correctly estimate environmental burdens and to propose effective environmental strategies. This chapter proposes the use of a mathematical modelling approach as an analytical tool that can support decision-making towards accomplishing the design and planning of efficient multiple source-multiple product bio-energy supply chains. The mathematical formulation of this problem becomes a multi-objective MILP (moMILP). Criteria selected for the objective function are the net present value (NPV) and the overall environmental impact, which is computed using the Impact 2002+ indicator. The main advantages of this approach are highlighted through a case study of a biomass-based supply chain that comprises different components geographically distributed over Spain. For comparison purposes, such a supply chain is contrasted to one embracing coal usage. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2011.},

	abstract = {To ensure effective biomass feedstock provision for large-scale biofuel production, an integrated biomass supply chain optimization model was developed to minimize annual biomass-ethanol production costs by optimizing both strategic and tactical planning decisions simultaneously. The mixed integer linear programming model optimizes the activities range from biomass harvesting, packing, in-field transportation, stacking, transportation, preprocessing, and storage, to ethanol production and distribution. The numbers, locations, and capacities of facilities as well as biomass and ethanol distribution patterns are key strategic decisions; while biomass production, delivery, and operating schedules and inventory monitoring are key tactical decisions. The model was implemented to study Miscanthus-ethanol supply chain in Illinois. The base case results showed unit Miscanthus-ethanol production costs were $0.72L>sup>-1>/sup> of ethanol. Biorefinery related costs accounts for 62% of the total costs, followed by biomass procurement costs. Sensitivity analysis showed that a 50% reduction in biomass yield would increase unit production costs by 11%. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main aim lies on the representation of the relationships between the biomass processing and biofuel energy conversion steps, and on the trade-offs between centralized district heating plants and local heat generation systems. After a description of state of the art and research trends in urban energy systems and bioenergy modelling, an application of the methodology to a generic case study is proposed. With the assumed techno-economic parameters, biomass based thermal energy generation results competitive with natural gas, while district heating network results the main option for urban areas with high thermal energy demand density.

	abstract = {Policy objectives to increase biomass' contribution to the energy supply in industrialised countries are quite ambitious, but biomass resources are rather limited and expensive in many situations. Therefore, an optimal utilisation of resources producing a maximum of energy at minimal costs is desirable. A wide variety of biomass conversion options with different performance characteristics exists. Also, the economic and energetic performance depends on many variables, such as costs of logistics, scaling effects and degree of heat utilisation to name a few. Therefore, system analysis is needed to identify optimal systems. In this study, different biomass energy systems are analysed regarding their energetic and economic performance related to fossil primary energy savings. The systems studied contain residual woody biomass, logistics, heat distribution and combustion or gasification units producing heat, power or CHP. The performance of systems is expressed as a function of scale. This is done by applying generic functions to describe plants' efficiencies and specific investment costs and by expressing costs and energy use of logistic and heat distribution as a function of conversion unit capacities. Scale effects within biomass energy systems are significant. Up-scaling increases the relative primary energy savings of the studied systems within the scale range of 0-300 MWth-input regarded, while costs per unit of primary energy savings decrease or have an optimum at medium scales. The relative primary energy savings lay between 0.53 and 1.13 GJfossil-saved GJbiomass-1. With costs of 4-20ε GJfossil-saved-1 systems are not profitable under Dutch conditions with residual wood prices of 3.8ε GJLHV-1 while firing waste wood with zero costs at the plant gate renders profitable operation possible. Favourable in both economic and energy terms are BIG/CC plants. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A thorough analysis of biomass supply and of energy demand should be carried out at local scale in order to optimize bioenergy plans and deal with the related social ad environmental issues. We present a method to identify the optimal use of biomass: local biomass availability is assessed, the road network is used to evaluate transportation costs, and different energy conversion technologies are considered. Energy crops and animal slurries are considered as feedstocks. We also estimate the amount of land available for energy crops, given the current land use. The comparison between possible conversion systems is carried out solving an optimization problem for the net energy produced in the system, accounting for energy needs for biomass cultivation, collection, and transportation. An emissive indicator is used to evaluate the amount of carbon equivalent emissions avoided. The economic performance of the systems is also analysed. The method is applied to the province of Ravenna in Italy. Transport and cultivation energy and emissions are much smaller than the energy produced or the emissions avoided. The biomass transformation chain can indeed provide 1.9-3.3% of the present power consumption and may reduce GHG emissions by 1-3.5% by replacing fossil fuels. © 2010, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

	abstract = {Global demand for lignocellulosic biomass is growing, driven by a desire to increase the contribution of renewable energy to the world energy mix. A barrier to the expansion of this industry is that biomass is not always geographically where it needs to be, nor does it have the characteristics required for efficient handling, storage, and conversion, due to low energy density compared to fossil fuels. Technologies exist that can create a more standardized feedstock for conversion processes and decrease handling and transport costs; however, the cost associated with those operations often results in a feedstock that is too expensive. The disconnect between quantity of feedstock needed to meet bioenergy production goals, the quality required by the conversion processes, and the cost bioenergy producers are able to pay creates a need for new and improved technologies that potentially remove barriers associated with biomass use. Because of their impact on feedstock cost, feedstock location and raw physical format are key barriers to industry expansion and intercontinental trade. One approach to reducing biomass cost is to emulate the commodity fossil-fuel-based feedstocks that biomass must compete with in terms of logistics, quality, and market characteristics. This requires preprocessing the biomass to improve density, flowability, stability, consistency, and conversion performance. Making the biomass format compatible with existing high-capacity transportation and handling infrastructure will reduce the need for new infrastructure. Producing biomass with these characteristics at costs conducive to energy production requires the development of new technologies or improvements to existing ones. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.},

	abstract = {Biomass gasification, utilized for various energy uses including power generation, provides an attractive option of energy security for remote rural communities and simultaneously helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, wider application of biomass gasification technology is limited due to a number of technical and economic challenges. Although a few studies have developed process-based models for reducing the costs of biomass supply chains through efficient logistics operations, there is a dearth of integrated modeling to capture the behaviour of the entire production system. In this paper an integrated non-linear dynamic mixed-integer programming model, using optimization and simulation techniques, is developed for biomass gasification power plants using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) computer software. The major variables considered in the model are harvesting and processing costs, logistic costs for biomass feedstock delivery and storage, capital costs of power plant, operation and maintenance costs including labour, insurance and capital financing, and other regulatory costs. The model provides different cost-benefit trajectories depending upon the scale of power generation from biomass gasification, thereby providing the prospective investors with information regarding market potential of the technology. The application of the model for setting up of a biomass gasification plant at a typical location in northwestern Ontario shows decreasing costs with increasing plant capacity up to 50 M W. The total cost per MWh production ranged from CAD 47.65 for a 50-MW plant to CAD 79.55 for a 10M-W plant.},

	abstract = {Feedstock logistics, as dictated by biomass physical properties, location, and distribution, as well as transportation infrastructure, were shown to be a primary determinant of the scale, location, and technology selection of any future biorefineries. The maximum capacity of both biochemical-and thermochemical-based second-generation biofuel facilities was established based on feedstock logistics including delivery mode (road, rail, or ship), maximum number of deliveries by mode, feedstock type (whole logs, chips, pellets, or bio-oil), and biofuel yield from those feedstocks. The world's largest ethanol plant, pulp mill, coal-based power plant, and oil refinery were used to approximate maximum plant size for different technologies, and to set an upper limit on the number of deliveries logistically possible for each transport mode. It was apparent that thermochemical conversion to transportation biofuels was favored for large, multimodal coastal facilities that are able to receive imported biomass in the form of feedstock intermediates, such as pellets and bio-oil (maximum capacities of 2844 and 6001 million liters gasoline equivalent (MLGE) respectively). Biochemically-based conversion processes, primarily due to smaller economies of scale and the typical use of higher moisture content and undensified feedstocks, such as whole logs and chips, are better suited for smaller facilities (maximum 1405 and 1542 MLGE, respectively) that rely on local feedstocks delivered by truck and/or rail. It was also apparent that optimization of the feedstock-intermediate-product chain, including biomass densification for transportation and high conversion yield, is essential if the scale of the any second-generation biofuels facility is to be maximized. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Despite the significant boost that some renewable energy sources have undergone lately, partly promoted by the favourable EU legislation, biomass seems to face difficulties in realising its expected share in energy production. Some major reasons for this are the complexity of a bioenergy system and its related fuel supply chain, the wide variety of available technologies and most importantly the low and uncertain financial yield of bioenergy projects. This paper utilizes an innovative generic methodology for performing investment analysis in parallel with optimization of the location and the key characteristics of the biomass-to-energy project. This methodology may serve as a decision support tool for potential investors and may assist in promoting relevant investment decisions. The model developed focuses on the holistic optimization of the design and operational characteristics of a biomass energy conversion facility, including the discrete phases of biomass logistics, energy conversion and final energy products supply. The innovative ideas of using multiple biomass sources as well as employing tri-generation for district energy applications aim at proposing a more cost-effective system layout for biomass energy exploitation. In addition to these ideas, the recent issue of emissions trading and its potential impact on a bioenergy project is investigated in this paper. The analysis performed concludes that emissions trading is of extremely high importance for biomass-to-energy projects, as it may prove to be a major revenue stream.},

It is the means by which raw biomass from the field or forest is mechanically transformed into an on-spec feedstock with characteristics better suited for the fuel conversion process. Results: This work provides a general overview of the objectives and methodologies of mechanical preprocessing and then presents experimental results illustrating improved size reduction via optimization of hammer mill configuration, improved size reduction via pneumatic-assisted hammer milling and improved control of particle size and particle-size distribution through proper selection of grinder process parameters. Conclusion: Optimal grinder configuration for maximal process throughput and efficiency is strongly dependent on feedstock type and properties, such as moisture content. Tests conducted using a HG200 hammer grinder indicate that tip speed, screen size and optimizing hammer geometry can increase grinder throughput as much as 400%. © 2013 Future Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the key factors on which the sustainable development of modern society should be based is the possibility to take advantage of renewable energies. Biomass resources are one of the most common and widespread resources in the world. Their use to produce energy has many advantages, such as the reduction of greenhouse emissions. This paper describes a GIS-based Environmental Decision Support System (EDSS) to define planning and management strategies for the optimal logistics for energy production from woody biomass, such as forest biomass, agricultural scraps and industrial and urban untreated wood residues. The EDSS is characterized by three main levels: the GIS, the database, and the optimization. The optimization module is divided in three sub-modules to face different kinds of decision problems: strategic planning, tactical planning, and operational management. The aim of this article is to describe the strategic planning level in detail. The decision variables are represented by plant capacity and harvested biomass in a specific forest parcel for each slope class, while the objective function is the sum of the costs related to plant installation and maintenance, biomass transportation and collection, minus the benefits coming from the energy sales at the current market price, including the renewable energy certificates. Moreover, the optimization problem is structured through a set of parameters and equations that are able to encompass different energy conversion technologies (pyrolysis, gasification or combustion) in the system. A case study on the Liguria Region (Savona Province) is presented and results are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Biofuel industry has attracted much attention due to its potential to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and contribute to the renewable energy. The high levels of uncertainty in feedstock yield, market prices, production costs, and many other parameters are among the major challenges in this industry. This challenge has created an ongoing interest on studies considering different aspects of uncertainty in investment decisions of the biofuel industry. This study aims to determine the optimal design of supply chain for biofuel refineries in order to maximize annual profit considering uncertainties in fuel market price, feedstock yield, and logistic costs. In order to deal with the stochastic nature of parameters in the biofuel supply chain, we develop two-stage stochastic programming models in which Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is utilized as a risk measure to control the amount of shortage in demand zones. Two different approaches including the expected value and CVaR of the profit are considered as the objective function. We apply these models and compare the results for a case study of the biomass supply chain network in the state of Iowa to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the presented models. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {To ensure effective biomass feedstock provision for large-scale ethanol production, a three-stage supply chain was proposed to include biomass supply sites, centralized storage and pre-processing (CSP) sites, and biorefinery sites. A GIS-enabled biomass supply chain optimization model (BioScope) was developed to minimize annual biomass-ethanol production costs by selectingthe optimal numbers, locations, and capacities of farms, CSPs, and biorefineries as well as identifying the optimal biomass flow pattern from farms to biorefineries. The model was implemented to study the Miscanthus-ethanol supply chain in Illinois. The results of the baseline case, assuming 2% of cropland is allocated for Miscanthus production, showed that unit Miscanthus-ethanol production costs were $220.6 Mg-1, or $0.74 L-1. Biorefinery-related costs are the largest cost component, accounting for 48% of the total costs, followed by biomass procurement, transportation, and CSP related costs. The unit Miscanthus-ethanol production costs could be reduced to $198 Mg-1 using 20% of cropland, primarily due to savings in transportation costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal supply chain configurations, including the numbers and locations of supply sites, CSP facilities, and biorefineries, changed significantly for different cropland usage rates, biomass demands, transportation means, and pre-processing technologies. A supply chain composed of large biorefineries with the support of distributed CSP facilities was recommended to reduce biofuels production costs. Rail outperformed truck transportation to ship pre-processed biomass. Ground biomass with tapping is the suggested biomass format for the case study in Illinois, while high-density biomass formats are suggested for long distance transportation. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons,Ltd.},

	abstract = {Bulk density of comminuted biomass significantly increased by vibration during handling and transportation, and by normal pressure during storage. Compaction characteristics affecting the bulk density of switchgrass, wheat straw, and corn stover chopped in a knife mill at different operating conditions and using four different classifying screens were studied. Mean loose-filled bulk densities were 67.5 ± 18.4 kg/m3 for switchgrass, 36.1 ± 8.6 kg/m3 for wheat straw, and 52.1 ± 10.8 kg/m3 for corn stover. Mean tapped bulk densities were 81.8 ± 26.2 kg/m3 for switchgrass, 42.8 ± 11.7 kg/m3 for wheat straw, and 58.9 ± 13.4 kg/m3 for corn stover. Percentage changes in compressibility due to variation in particle size obtained from a knife mill ranged from 64.3 to 173.6 for chopped switchgrass, 22.2-51.5 for chopped wheat straw and 42.1-117.7 for chopped corn stover within the tested consolidation pressure range of 5-120 kPa. Pressure and volume relationship of chopped biomass during compression with application of normal pressure can be characterized by the Walker model and Kawakita and Ludde model. Parameter of Walker model was correlated to the compressibility with Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.9. Relationship between volume reduction in chopped biomass with respect to number of tappings studied using Sone's model indicated that infinite compressibility was highest for chopped switchgrass followed by chopped wheat straw and corn stover. Degree of difficulty in packing measured using the parameters of Sone's model indicated that the chopped wheat straw particles compacted very rapidly by tapping compared to chopped switchgrass and corn stover. These results are very useful for solving obstacles in handling bulk biomass supply logistics issues for a biorefinery. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Biomass is one of the alternative energy resources and agricultural, animal and industrial organic wastes can be treated as biomass feedstock in biomass to energy conversion systems. This study aims to develop an effective supply chain network design model for the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion of biomass. In this regard, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to determine the most appropriate locations for the biogas plants and biomass storages. Besides the strategic decisions such as determining the numbers, capacities and locations of biogas plants and biomass storages, the biomass supply and product distribution decisions can also be made by this model. Mainly, waste biomass is considered as feedstock to be digested in anaerobic digestion facilities. To explore the viability of the proposed model, computational experiments are performed on a real-world problem. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to account for the uncertainties in the input data to the decision problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study compared the economic and environmental impacts of torrefaction on bioenergy supply chains against conventional pellets for scenarios where biomass is produced in Mozambique, and undergoes pre-processing before shipment to Rotterdam for conversion to power and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels. We also compared the impacts of using different land quality (productive and marginal) for feedstock production, feedstocks (eucalyptus and switchgrass), final conversion technologies (XtY and CXtY) and markets (the Netherlands and Mozambique). At current conditions, the torrefied pellets (TOPs) are delivered in Rotterdam at higher cost (7.3-7.5 $/GJ) than pellets (5.1-5.3 $/GJ). In the long term, TOPs costs could decline (4.7-5.8 $/GJ) and converge with pellets. TOPs supply chains also incur 20% lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than pellets. Due to improved logistics and lower conversion investment, fuel production costs from TOPs are lower (12.8-16.9 $/GJFT) than from pellets (12.9-18.7 $/GJFT). Co-firing scenarios (CXtY) result in lower cost fuel (but a higher environmental penalty) than 100% biomass fired scenarios (XtY). In most cases, switchgrass and the productive region of Nampula provide the lowest fuel production cost compared to eucalyptus and the marginally productive Gaza region. Both FT and ion in Mozambique are more costly than in Rotterdam. For the Netherlands, both FT and power production are competitive against average energy costs in Western Europe. The analysis shows that large-scale bioenergy production can become competitive against fossil fuels. While the benefits of TOPs are apparent in logistics and conversion, the current higher torrefaction costs contribute to higher biofuel costs. Improvements in torrefaction technology can result in significant performance improvements over the future chain. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This work is focused on the use of biomass waste to feed already existing coal combustion plants as a part of paving the way toward the reduction of the environmental impact. The biomass waste supply chain optimization is critical to conceive long-term viable projects and deal with the biomass heterogeneous nature and drawbacks to be used with coal, i.e. principally high moisture content and low bulk density. This paper studies biomass transportation, storage and change of properties (moisture content and hence dry matter, energy density and bulk density) through the use of different pre-treatments: (i) torrefaction, (ii) torrefaction combined with pelletization, (iii) pelletization, (iv) fast pyrolysis and (v) fast pyrolysis combined with char grinding, which produce a range of very different pre-treated biomass. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that evaluates the net present value and the environmental impact through a life cycle assessment (LCA). The results propose location-allocation decision together with the selection/capacity of pre-treatment technologies for each scenario. The scenarios contemplate different biomass characteristics, availability and distribution for a supply chain case study located in Spain: forest and agricultural woody residues used to replace at least 10% of the total thermal inlet power provided by coal in the existing network of thermal plants. © 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the novel MILP formulation of the Biomass Value Chain Model (BVCM), a comprehensive and flexible optimisation toolkit that models a large number of bioenergy system pathways. The model accounts for the economic and environmental impacts associated with the end-to-end elements of a pathway: crop production, conversion technologies, transport, storage, local purchase, import (from abroad), sale and disposal of resources, as well as CO2 sequestration by CCS technologies and forestry. It supports decision-making around optimal use of land, biomass resources and technologies with respect to different objectives, scenarios and constraints. Objectives include minimising cost, maximising profit, minimising GHG emissions, maximising energy/exergy production or any combination of these. These objectives are combined with a number of scenarios (such as including different CO2 prices, different technology and climate scenarios, import scenarios, waste cost scenarios), different credits (e.g. by-product and end-product, CCS and forestry carbon sequestration) and a number of constraints such as minimum levels of energy production and maximum environmental impacts. The toolkit includes an extensive database of different biomass technologies including pretreatment, densification, liquid and gaseous fuel production, heat and power generation (separately or combined, biodedicated or co-fired), waste-to-energy conversion and carbon capture and sequestration. A large number of resources are considered including a variety of bio-resources (e.g. energy crops such as Miscanthus and SRC willow, arable crops such as winter wheat, sugar beet and oilseed rape and short and long rotation forestry), intermediates, products, by-products and wastes. The BVCM is a spatio-temporal model: currently it is configured for the UK using 157 square cells of length 50. km and the planning horizon is from the 2010s to the 2050s, with seasonal variations considered. The framework is data-driven so the model can be easily extended: for example adding new resources, technologies, transport modes, etc. or changing the time horizon and the location to another country is only a matter of changing the data. Results of example UK case studies are presented to demonstrate the functionality of the model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzed the uniqueness and challenges in designing the logistics system for dedicated biomass-to-bioenergy industry, which differs from the other industries, due to the unique features of dedicated biomass (e.g., switchgrass) including its low bulk density, restrictions on harvesting season and frequency, content variation with time and circumambient conditions, weather effects, scattered distribution over a wide geographical area, and so on. To design it, this paper proposed a mixed integer linear programming model. It covered from planting and harvesting switchgrass to delivering to a biorefinery and included the residue handling, concentrating on integrating strategic decisions on the supply chain design and tactical decisions on the annual operation schedules. The present numerical examples verified the model and demonstrated its use in practice. This paper showed that the operations of the logistics system were significantly different for harvesting and non-harvesting seasons, and that under the well-designed biomass logistics system, the mass production with a steady and sufficient supply of biomass can increase the unit profit of bioenergy. The analytical model and practical methodology proposed in this paper will help realize the commercial production in biomass-to-bioenergy industry. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The focus is on spatial and temporal allocation of biomass supply, storage, processing, transport and energy conversion (heat and CHP) to match the heat demand of residential end users. The main aim lies on the assessment of the trade-offs between centralized district heating plants and local heat generation systems, and on the decoupling of the biomass processing and biofuel energy conversion steps. After a brief description of the methodology, which is presented in detail in Part I of the research, an application to a generic urban area is proposed. Moreover, the influence of energy demand typologies (urban areas energy density, heat consumption patterns, buildings energy efficiency levels, baseline energy costs and available infrastructures) and specific constraints of urban areas (transport logistics, air emission levels, space availability) on the selection of optimal bioenergy pathways for heat and power is assessed, by means of sensitivity analysis. On the basis of these results, broad considerations about the key factors influencing the use of bioenergy into urban energy systems are proposed. Potential further applications of this model are also described, together with main barriers for development of bioenergy routes for urban areas. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Agricultural residue feedstock availability in a given region can vary significantly over the 20-30+ year lifetime of a biorefinery. Delivered cost of biomass feedstock is dependent upon transportation distance and equipment optimisation, both of which are largely dictated by biomass productivity. This makes productivity the primary determinant of feedstock cost. Using the Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) dynamic model and a round bale, small grains residue scenario, harvest and delivery cost were modelled for minimum, average, and maximum biomass yields at four potential biorefinery sites in the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada. Biorefinery capacities ranged from 50 000 to 500 000 tonnes of feedstock input per year. Delivery cost is a linear function of transportation distance and can be combined with a harvest power function to create a generalised delivered cost function for agricultural residues. The range in delivered cost is substantial and is an important consideration for the operating costs of a biorefinery. © 2009 IAgrE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) for multi-biomass energy conversion applications is presented. The system in question aims at supporting an investor by thoroughly assessing an investment in locally existing multi-biomass exploitation for tri-generation applications (electricity, heating and cooling), in a given area. The approach followed combines use of holistic modelling of the system, including the multi-biomass supply chain, the energy conversion facility and the district heating and cooling network, with optimization of the major investment-related variables to maximize the financial yield of the investment. The consideration of multi-biomass supply chain presents significant potential for cost reduction, by allowing spreading of capital costs and reducing warehousing requirements, especially when seasonal biomass types are concerned. The investment variables concern the location of the bioenergy exploitation facility and its sizing, as well as the types of biomass to be procured, the respective quantities and the maximum collection distance for each type. A hybrid optimization method is employed to overcome the inherent limitations of every single method. The system is demand-driven, meaning that its primary aim is to fully satisfy the energy demand of the customers. Therefore, the model is a practical tool in the hands of an investor to assess and optimize in financial terms an investment aiming at covering real energy demand. Optimization is performed taking into account various technical, regulatory, social and logical constraints.

A two-stage stochastic mathematical model is proposed to maximize expected profit by optimizing the strategic and tactical decisions. A case study based on ND (North Dakota) state in the U.S. demonstrates that in a stochastic environment it is cost effective to meet 100% of ND's annual gasoline demand from bioethanol by using switchgrass as a primary and crop residue as a secondary biomass feedstock. Although results show that the financial performance is degraded as variability of the uncertain parameters increases, the proposed stochastic model increasingly outperforms the deterministic model under uncertainties. The locations of biorefineries (i.e. first-stage integer variables) are insensitive to the uncertainties. Sensitivity analysis shows that "mean" value of stochastic parameters has a significant impact on the expected profit and optimal values of first-stage continuous variables. Increase in level of mean ethanol demand and mean sale price results in higher bioethanol production. When mean switchgrass yield is at low level and mean crop residue price is at high level, all the available marginal land is used for switchgrass cultivation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {When planning bioenergy production from biomass, planners should take into account each and every stakeholder along the biomass supply chains, e.g. biomass resources suppliers, transportation, conversion and electricity suppliers. Also, the planners have to consider social concerns, environmental and economical impacts related with establishing the biomass systems and the specific difficulties of each country. To overcome these problems in a sustainable manner, a robust decision support system is required. For that purpose, a two levels general Bioenergy Decision System (gBEDS) for bioenergy production planning and implementation was developed. The core part of the gBEDS is the information base, which includes the basic bioenergy information and the detailed decision information. Basic bioenergy information include, for instance, the geographical information system (GIS) database, the biomass materials' database, the biomass logistic database and the biomass conversion database. The detailed decision information considers the parameters' values database with their default values and the variables database, values obtained by simulation and optimization. It also includes a scenario database, which is used for demonstration to new users and also for case based reasoning by planners and executers. Based on the information base, the following modules are included to support decision making: the simulation module with graph interface based on the unit process (UP) definition and the genetic algorithms (GAs) methods for optimal decisions and the Matlab module for applying data mining methods (fuzzy C-means clustering and decision trees) to the biomass collection points, to define the location of storage and bioenergy conversion plants based on the simulation and optimization model developed of the whole life cycle of bioenergy generation. Furthermore, Matlab is used to set up a calculation model with crucial biomass planning parameters (e.g. costs, CO2 emissions), over the predefined biomass supply chains. The GIS based interface allows visualization of all bioenergy conversion plants and storage data to support the users' decision based on quantifiable outputs. With the help of the graphical interface, the users can define easily the feasible biomass supply chains, take decisions and evaluate them according to their own interests, might they be environmental, economical, social or others. Therefore, the gBEDS supports biomass energy planners in both national and regional levels to assess the options (technically and economically) of biomass utilization and plan for bioenergy generation in a competent and sustainable way. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this supply chain, biomass is converted to bio-oil at widely distributed small-scale fast pyrolysis plants, and after bio-oil gasification, the syngas is upgraded to transportation fuels at a centralized biorefinery. A two-stage stochastic programming is formulated to maximize biofuel producers' annual profit considering uncertainties in the supply chain for this pathway. The first stage makes the capital investment decisions including the locations and capacities of the decentralized fast pyrolysis plants as well as the centralized biorefinery, while the second stage determines the biomass and biofuels flows. A case study based on Iowa in the U.S. illustrates that it is economically feasible to meet desired demand using corn stover as the biomass feedstock. The results show that the locations of fast pyrolysis plants are sensitive to uncertainties while the capacity levels are insensitive. The stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model in the stochastic environment, especially when there is insufficient biomass. Also, farmers' participation can have a significant impact on the profitability and robustness of this supply chain. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Application of logistic, Luedeking-Piret and the modified Luedeking-Piret mathematical models to the kinetic data revealed that α-amylase production in both cases occurred through both growth- and non-growth associated mechanisms and that the amount of enzyme produced through non-growth associated mechanism exceeded that produced through growth associated mechanism by 3.5 and 2.3 fold by strains 267 and 267CH, respectively. Although with both strains substrate consumption continued even after growth leveled, the application of the model revealed that the major portion of substrate consumption occurred during growth but that a considerable amount was also consumed after maximum growth was reached, mainly for enzyme production. In the bioreactor, increasing aeration from 1 to 2 vvm increased the overall specific growth rate, the production rate, the specific production rate, and the specific substrate consumption rate and also shortened the time necessary for maximum production of both biomass and enzyme. The increase in biomass either by prolonging the incubation time or by increasing aeration was accompanied by an increase in enzyme production. However, even after maximum biomass was reached, enzyme production still continued to increase, under both conditions. © 2008 Academic Journals.},

The decision variables in the model are monthly harvest levels of two types of woody biomass, forest harvest residues and unutilized biomass, from 19,315 forest depletion cells (each 1 km2) for a one year planning horizon. Sixteen scenarios are tested to examine the sensitivity of the cost minimization model to changing economic and technological parameters. Reduction in moisture content and improvement of conversion efficiency showed relatively higher reductions in monthly and total costs of woody biomass feedstock for the AGS.

	abstract = {Forest biomass is one of the renewable sources of energy that has been used for generating electricity. The feasibility and cost of producing electricity from forest biomass depend on long term availability of biomass, its cost and quality, and the cost of collecting, pre-processing, handling, transportation, and storage of forest biomass, in addition to the operating and maintenance costs of the conversion facility. To improve the cost competitiveness of forest biomass for electricity generation, mathematical programming models can be used to manage and optimize its supply chain. In this paper, the supply chain configuration of a typical forest biomass power plant is presented and a dynamic optimization model is developed to maximize the overall value of the supply chain. The model considers biomass procurement, storage, energy production and ash management in an integrated framework at the tactical level. The developed model is a nonlinear mixed integer programming which is solved using the outer approximation algorithm provided in AIMMS software package. It is then applied to optimize the supply chain of a real biomass power plant in Canada. The optimum solution provides more profit compared to the actual profit of the power plant. Different scenarios for maximum available supply and also investment in a new ash recovery system were evaluated and the results were analyzed. The model in particular shows that investment in a new ash recovery system has economic as well as environmental benefits for the power plant. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {As biorefining conversion technologies become commercial, feedstock availability, supply system logistics, and biomass material attributes are emerging as major barriers to the availability of corn stover for biorefining. While systems do exist to supply corn stover as feedstock to biorefining facilities, stover material attributes affecting physical deconstruction, such as densification and post-harvest material stability, challenge the cost-effectiveness of present-day feedstock logistics systems. In addition, the material characteristics of corn stover create barriers with any supply system design in terms of equipment capacity/efficiency, dry matter loss, and capital use efficiency. However, analysis of a conventional large square bale corn stover feedstock supply system concludes that (1) where other agronomic factors are not limiting, corn stover can be accessed and supplied to a biorefinery using existing bale-based technologies, (2) technologies and new supply system designs are necessary to overcome biomass bulk density and moisture material property challenges, and (3) major opportunities to improve conventional bale biomass feedstock supply systems include improvements in equipment efficiency and capacity and reducing biomass losses in harvesting, collection, and storage. Finally, the backbone of an effective stover supply system design is the optimization of intended and minimization of unintended material property changes as the corn stover passes through the individual supply system processes from the field to the biorefinery conversion processes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

The supply chain consists of multisite distributed-centralized processing networks for biomass conversion and liquid transportation fuel production. The economic objective is measured by the total annualized cost, and the measure of environmental performance is the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. A multiobjective, multiperiod, mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed that takes into account diverse conversion pathways and technologies, feedstock seasonality, geographical diversity, biomass degradation, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, and government incentives. The model simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production planning, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. The problem is formulated as a bicriterion optimization model and solved with the ε-constraint method. The resulting Pareto-optimal curve reveals how the optimal annualized cost and the BTL processing network structure change with different environmental performances of the supply chain. The proposed approach is illustrated through a county-level case study for the state of Iowa. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is being developed as a biofuel feedstock for the United States. Efficient and accurate methods to estimate switchgrass biomass feedstock supply within a production area will be required by biorefineries. Our main objective was to determine the effectiveness of indirect methods for estimating biomass yields and composition of switchgrass fields. Indirect measurements were conducted in eastern Nebraska from 2003 to 2007 in which switchgrass biomass yields were manipulated using three nitrogen rates (0 kg N ha -1, 60 kg N ha -1, and 120 kg N ha -1) and two harvest periods (August and post-killing frost). A modified Robel pole was used to determine visual obstruction, elongated leaf height, and canopy height measurements. Prediction models from the study showed that elongated leaf height, visual obstruction, and canopy height measurements accounted for >91%, >90%, and >82% of the variation in switchgrass biomass, respectively. Regression slopes were similar by cultivar ("Cave-in-Rock" and "Trailblazer"), harvest period, and across years indicating that a single model is applicable for determining biomass feedstock supply within a region, assuming similar harvesting methods. Sample numbers required to receive the same level of precision were as follows: elongated leaf height<canopy height<visual obstruction. Twenty to 30 elongated leaf height measurements in a field could predict switchgrass biomass yield within 10% of the mean with 95% confidence. Visual obstruction is recommended on switchgrass fields with low to variable stand densities while elongated leaf height measurements would be recommended on switchgrass fields with high, uniform stand densities. Incorporating an ocular device with a Robel pole provided reasonable frequency estimates of switchgrass, broadleaf weeds, and grassy weeds at the field scale. © 2010 US Government.},

Supply chain-design decisions are long-term type of decisions; while logistics management involves medium to short-term decisions. The proposed model coordinates these decisions. The model determines the number, size and location of biorefineries needed to produce biofuel using the available biomass. The model also determines the amount of biomass shipped, processed and inventoried during a time period.

	abstract = {A mathematical model was developed and tested to simulate the generation and transfer of heat in solid substrate fermentation (SSF). The experimental studies were realized in a 1‐L static bioreactor packed with cassava wet meal and inoculated with Aspergillus niger. A simplified pseudohomogeneous monodimensional dynamic model was used for the energy balance. Kinetic equations taking into account biomass formation (logistic), sugar consumption (with maintenance), and carbon dioxide formation were used. Model verification was achieved by comparison of calculated and experimental temperatures. Heat transfer was evaluated by the estimation of Biot and Peclet heat dimensionless numbers 5–10 and 2550–2750, respectively. It was shown that conduction through the fermentation fixed bed was the main heat transfer resistance. This model intends to reach a better understanding of transport phenomena in SSF, a fact which could be used to evaluate various alternatives for temperature control of SSF, i.e., changing air flow rates and increasing water content. Dimensionless numbers could be used as scale‐up criteria of large fermentors, since in those ratios are described the operating conditions, geometry, and size of the bioreactor. It could lead to improved solid reactor systems. The model can be used as a basis for automatic control of SSF for the production of valuable metabolites in static fermentors.

	abstract = {Bio-fuels represent promising candidates for renewable liquid fuels. One of the challenges for the emerging industry is the high level of uncertainty in supply amounts, market demands, market prices, and processing technologies. These uncertainties complicate the assessment of investment decisions. This paper presents a model for the optimal design of biomass supply chain networks under uncertainty. The uncertainties manifest themselves as a large number of stochastic model parameters that could impact the overall profitability and design. The supply chain network we study covers the Southeastern region of the United States and includes biomass supply locations and amounts, candidate sites and capacities for two kinds of fuel conversion processing, and the logistics of transportation from the locations of forestry resources to the conversion sites and then to the final markets.To reduce the design problem to a manageable size the impact of each uncertain parameter on the objective function is computed for each end of the parameter's range. The parameters that cause the most change in the profit over their range are then combined into scenarios that are used to find a design through a two stage mixed integer stochastic program. The first stage decisions are the capital investment decisions including the size and location of the processing plants. The second stage recourse decisions are the biomass and product flows in each scenario. The objective is the maximization of the expected profit over the different scenarios. The robustness and global sensitivity analysis of the nominal design (for a single nominal scenario) vs. the robust design (for multiple scenarios) are analyzed using Monte Carlo simulation over the hypercube formed from the parameter ranges. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Lignocellulosic bioethanol technologies exhibit significant capacity for performance improvement across the supply chain through the development of high-yielding energy crops, integrated pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation technologies and the application of dedicated ethanol pipelines. The impact of such developments on cost-optimal plant location, scale and process composition within multiple plant infrastructures is poorly understood. A combined production and logistics model has been developed to investigate cost-optimal system configurations for a range of technological, system scale, biomass supply and ethanol demand distribution scenarios specific to European agricultural land and population densities. Results: Ethanol production costs for current technologies decrease significantly from $0.71 to $0.58 per litre with increasing economies of scale, up to a maximum single-plant capacity of 550 × 106 l year-1. The development of high-yielding energy crops and consolidated bio-processing realises significant cost reductions, with production costs ranging from $0.33 to $0.36 per litre. Increased feedstock yields result in systems of eight fully integrated plants operating within a 500 × 500 km2 region, each producing between 1.24 and 2.38 × 109 l year-1 of pure ethanol. A limited potential for distributed processing and centralised purification systems is identified, requiring developments in modular, ambient pretreatment and fermentation technologies and the pipeline transport of pure ethanol. Conclusion: The conceptual and mathematical modelling framework developed provides a valuable tool for the assessment and optimisation of the lignocellulosic bioethanol supply chain. In particular, it can provide insight into the optimal configuration of multiple plant systems. This information is invaluable in ensuring (near-)cost-optimal strategic development within the sector at the regional and national scale. The framework is flexible and can thus accommodate a range of processing tasks, logistical modes, by-product markets and impacting policy constraints. Significant scope for application to real-world case studies through dynamic extensions of the formulation has been identified. © 2008 Dunnett et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Demand for alternative feedstocks for fuels, chemicals, and a range of commercial products has grown dramatically in the early years of the 21st century, driven by the high price of petroleum, government policy to promote alternatives and reduce dependence on foreign oil, and growing efforts to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Ethanol production has more than tripled since 2000, with annual US production expected to exceed 7 billion gallons by 2007. Sales of biobased plastics are also expanding. The growing availability of economically competitive biobased alternatives to petroleum can be attributed in large part to advances in the production and processing of corn grain for industrial uses. Steady increases in corn yields made possible by agricultural biotechnology continue to expand the supply of available grainbased feedstock. Rapid advances in the field of industrial biotechnology are greatly enhancing the efficiency of ethanol production and making possible a range of new biobased polymers, plastics, and textiles from agricultural starting materials. In order to meet the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of 60 million gallons of ethanol production and 30 percent displacement of petroleum by 2030, new feedstock sources will be required to supplement high-efficiency production from grain. A robust sustainable supply chain for cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops will be needed within a few years.Nearly 1 billion dry tons of cellulosic biomass could be supplied by US agricultural lands in the form of crop residues and dedicated energy crops. A growing list of companies have announced intentions to begin construction of cellulosic biorefinerics. One challenge for the emerging cellulosic biomass industry is how to produce, harvest, and deliver this abundant feedstock to biorefineries in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. Corn stover and straw from cereals such as wheat and rice are the most likely cellulosic Feedstocks for commercial-scale production of ethanol in the near term, potentially supplying more than 200 million dry tons of feedstock annually within three to five years-enough to triple current ethanol production. Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass will follow as a feedstock supplement once a market for cellulosic biomass develops further. Corn stover has the largest potential as a near-term biorefinery feedstock, given its high per-acre yields. Current cropping practices require that most or all stover remain on the field to maintain soil health. As biorefinery construction creates markets for crop residues, farmers will be more motivated to adopt practices that lead to economic and sustainable removal. An environmental and economic "optimum" removal will balance sufficient retention of residues to avoid erosion losses and maintain soil quality while using excess residue as biorefinery feedstocks. The impact of varying levels of stover and straw removal will depend considerably on local conditions and practices.Under a range of conditions, no-till cropping allows for substantially greater residue collection than current practice, enabling biorefinery siting in areas where suitable supplies are currently unavailable. Further evolution toward greater no-till cropping is needed in order to supply adequate feedstock while complying with erosion guidelines and maintaining soil quality. Lower operating costs and recent successes have spurred an increase in adoption of no-till, with 16 percent of wheat acreage and 20 percent of corn acreage now under no-till practice. However, no-till is not yet widely utilized in regions of the country with the greatest potential to supply biomass. Ultimately, growing demand for crop residues will likely prove a strong additional driver for the transition to more widespread no-till cropping. Once a market for agricultural residues develops, individual farmers or groups of farmers may elect to adopt no-till cropping to attract biorefineries to their area. Residue collection may also enable no-till cropping in wetter regions, such as the northern Com Belt, where excess residues currently hamper germination and reduce yields. While the economics depend on regional and local conditions, for those not currently practicing no-till, the benefits of converting may justiry the time to learn new methods and the $50,000-$100,000 investment in new planting equipment. For instance, a 1,000-acre farm could expect to recover the additional costs through revenue from residue sales in as little as two years. New markets that commoditize the environmental benefits of notill farming could provide even greater incentive to convert. Carbon credits for no-till transition currently sell for roughly $1 per acre on the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange. If mandatory greenhouse gas limits are established in the United States, the carbon credit benefits of no-till adoption could exceed $10 per acre. In addition to economic benefits for farmers, sustainable production, and collection of agricultural residues has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for the environment, such as reduced runoff of soil and fertilizers. But the greatest environmental benefit may be to the global climate through reduced emissions of fossil carbon and enhanced sequestration of soil carbon. With no-till cropping, sustainable collection of 30 percent of current annual corn stover production would yield over 5 billion gallons of ethanol and reduce net US greenhouse gas emissions by 90 million to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, if burned as E85 fuel. This would more than offset the net annual growth in emissions from all sectors of the US economy experienced in 2004. To realize these benefits, additional infrastructure in collection, storage, and transportation is needed to supply biorefineries. Rail transport greatly reduces transportation costs relative to trucking, allowing for a much larger collection area. One-pass harvest, in which grain and residues are collected simultaneously, also offers strong opportunities to lower cost.To facilitate development of the infrastructure necessary for sustainable production and collection of cellulosic agricultural feed-stocks, and to achieve the DOE goal of 30 percent displacement of petroleum with renewable biobased feedstocks by 2030, the US Congress should consider adopting supportive policy measures in the 2007 Farm Bill, including: Funding for accelerated development and production of onepass harvesting equipment Development and distribution of simple-to-use soil carbon models to allow farmers to compute how much crop residue can be collected without degrading soil quality Assistance to farmers to encourage the transition to no-till cropping for biomass production Incentives for the development and expansion of short-line and regional rail networks Funding for demonstration projects to streamline collection, transport, and storage of cellulosic crop residue feedstocks Development of a system to monetize greenhouse gas credits generated by production of ethanol and other products from agricultural feedstocks Funding for programs to help farmers identify and grow the most suitable crops for both food production and cellulosic biomass production Cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops represents a highly promising new source of feedstock material for the production of ethanol, renewable chemicals, and a range of commercial biobased products. Residues from existing crops can be utilized to greatly expand current biofuels production.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model to maximize the expected profit and simultaneously minimize carbon emissions of a dual-feedstock lignocellulosic-based bioethanol supply chain (LBSC) under uncertainties in supply, demand and prices. The model decides the optimal first-stage decisions and the expected values of the second-stage decisions. A case study based on a 4-state Midwestern region in the US demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model over a deterministic model under uncertainties. Two regional modes are considered for the geographic scale of the LBSC. Under co-operation mode the 4 states are considered as a combined region while under stand-alone mode each of the 4 states is considered as an individual region. Each state under co-operation mode gives better financial and environmental outcomes when compared to stand-alone mode. Uncertainty has a significant impact on the biomass processing capacity of biorefineries. While the location and the choice of conversion technology for biorefineries i.e. biochemical vs. thermochemical, are insensitive to the stochastic environment. As variability of the stochastic parameters increases, the financial and environmental performance is degraded. Sensitivity analysis shows that levels of tax credit and carbon price have a major impact on the choice of conversion technology for a selected biorefinery. Biochemical pathway is preferred over the thermochemical as carbon price increases. Thermochemical pathway is preferred over the biochemical as the level of tax credit increases. In addition, bioethanol production in the US is shown to be unviable without adequate governmental subsidy in the form of tax credits. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Given the location of a bio-energy plant for the conversion of biomass to bio-energy, a feedstock logistics system that relies on the use of satellite storage locations (SSLs) for temporary storage and loading of round bales is proposed. Three equipment systems are considered for handling biomass at the SSLs, and they are either placed permanently or are mobile and thereby travel from one SSL to another. A mathematical programming-based approach is utilized to determine SSLs and equipment routes in order to minimize the total cost. The use of a Side-loading Rack System results in average savings of 21.3% over a Densification System while a Rear-loading Rack System is more expensive to operate than either of the other equipment systems. The utilization of mobile equipment results in average savings of 14.8% over the equipment placed permanently. Furthermore, the Densification System is not justifiable for transportation distances less than 81. km. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general optimization model that enables the selection of fuel conversion technologies, capacities, biomass locations, and the logistics of transportation from the locations of forestry resources to the conversion sites and then to the final markets. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated and implemented in a commercial software package (GAMS) using databases built in Excel. The MILP represents decisions regarding (1) the optimal number, locations, and sizes of various types of processing plants, (2) the amounts of biomass, intermediate products, and final products to be transported between the selected locations over a selected period, and maximizes the objective function of overall profit. The model has been tested based on an industry-representative data set that contains information on the existing wood resources, final product market locations and demands, and candidate locations and sizes for different types of processing plants, as well as the costs associated with the various processing units and transportation of materials, covering the Southeastern region of the United States. The model is applied to design both a distributed, and a more centralized, conversion system. The overall profits, values, cost, and supply network designs of both systems are analyzed using the optimization model. In particular, we investigate: 1) which parameters have major effect on the overall economics, and 2) the benefits of going to more distributed types of processing networks, in terms of the overall economics and the robustness to demand variations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cellulosic ethanol based on agricultural residues is a potential alternative to fossil fuel. This new alternative is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) compared to the current fossil fuel used for transportation. Many countries have legislated a renewable fuel standard (RFS) with biofuel blending regulations for transportation fuel. The aim of this study is to estimate the potential quantity of rice straw and ethanol production with the associated cost and CO2-equivalent GHGs. It also examines the environmental implications of the RFS considering all stages from cradle to gate, including rice straw collection and ethanol distribution. The available production of rice straw ethanol is about 1.2 billion L considering the current demand, which can achieve the 5% ethanol blended gasoline (E5) standard in South Korea. The optimum cost for ethanol from rice straw is expected to be 0.956 US$ L-1 with 6,000 Mg d-1 by constructing two biorefineries in Dangjin and Gwangju. Domestic ethanol from rice straw can reduce CO2-equivalent GHGs to 2,614 g L-1 (90.6%), and imported ethanol from Brazil can reduce CO2-equivalent GHGs to 1,907 g L-1 (66.1%) compared to conventional gasoline (2,885 g of CO2-equivalent GHGs L-1). Considering the amount of expected displacement for current domestic gasoline, the potential GHG reduction can be 1.0 million Mg of CO2-equivalent GHGs per year, and the blended fuel price (1.864 US$ L-1) would be similar to that of conventional gasoline (1.870 US$ L-1) with E5. © 2014 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.},
