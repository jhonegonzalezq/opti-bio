   abstract = {Sustainability is under threat due to inefficient waste management. In the industrial sector, mechanisms such as value chains and producer obligations have advanced circular economy practices. However, in the agroforestry sector, open burning of waste remains prevalent, resulting in resource loss and heightened fire risks. This scenario jeopardizes the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability, underscoring the need for legal frameworks to ensure waste recovery. This study proposes a regulatory framework to enhance the circular economy in agroforestry waste management. A benchmarking analysis was conducted to examine waste recovery systems where circular economy principles are successfully implemented. Insights from these systems were integrated with an in-depth assessment of the agroforestry biomass recovery chain to develop actionable regulatory measures. The proposed framework includes measures such as mandatory delivery of biomass, creation of aggregation centers, and incentives for biomass recovery. These measures are tailored to reduce fire risks, improve resource efficiency, and align stakeholders’ practices with sustainability goals. Visual tools, including comparative tables and diagrams, illustrate the framework’s impact. The study highlights the potential of regulatory interventions to promote agroforestry waste recovery, supporting sustainable development. Future work should focus on pilot implementations to validate the framework’s effectiveness in real-world scenarios. © 2025 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Supply chain resilience has been extensively investigated at the network and firm levels. More granular studies at the level of product supply chain resilience are scarce. In this paper, we examine relationships between product supply chain resilience, firm resilience, and network resilience. We simulate supply chains with two products in different settings of structural and process diversity, connectivity, and flexibility. The methodology is based on discrete-event simulation. The focus of the analysis is on managerial insights. Our main insights show that the resilience of product supply chains depends on the firm and network resilience, and higher firm and network resilience do not always automatically translate into higher resilience at the product level. Managerial implications are discussed and generalized. The outcomes of our study can be used by supply chain and operations managers to improve the resilience of supply chain with consideration of both product and network levels. We contribute to the literature by offering novel insights on the interrelations between firm and network resilience practices and product supply chain resilience. © 2025 The Author(s).

   abstract = {Currently, there is an increasing pressure to decarbonize and meet energy demands. In this regard, the usage of renewable energy sources is becoming more prominent. Biomass energy can significantly contribute to this effort. However, due to logistical costs, its exploitation is often considered less ‘desirable.’ Sometimes, particularly in the context of residual biomass, open burning on site is desirable. This study aims to optimize the residual biomass supply chain by leveraging digitalization's advantages, thereby creating a new model for this purpose. Methodologically, this research initially adopted an empirical approach, analyzing documents from a project that recreated the current scenario. In its second phase, the study involved a literature review to gather insights needed for developing the final model. Consequently, this study offers three major contributions: a detailed mapping of the current scenario, a comprehensive synthesis of the potentials of emerging technologies in the supply chain, and a model illustrating the integration of these technologies in the context of residual biomass. Thus, this research presents an opportunity to transform a common ‘leftover’ into a value-added material. To better assess the model's value, two analyses, PEST and SWOT, were conducted to align the conceptual proposal with real-world contexts. © 2024 The Authors},

   abstract = {Background: The dynamics of supply chain networks have changed due to increasing complexities. Global expansions and knowledge transfer in supply chain networks bring efficiency and effectiveness to companies. However, the probability of supply chain complexity has also been seen increasing. The barriers to sustainable supply chain networks need to be tackled in an effective manner as they impact business operations. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate and reduce the supply chain complexities, as it will facilitate the process of knowledge transfer and increase the implementation of sustainable practises in supply chain networks. In the previous research, four supply chain complexity drivers were identified. Previous research identified four supply chain complexity drivers by conducting a systematic review. This study investigates which of the four complexity drivers impacts knowledge transfer in the context of the food supply chain sector. Methods: In this research, knowledge transfer is therefore examined from the perspective of sustainable food supply chains. Thirty exploratory qualitative interviews were conducted in this study and analysed using Nvivo (v12) software. This study utilised thematic analysis techniques for the evaluation of the interviews to gather results. Results: The results illustrated six main factors classified under broad categories: integration of Knowledge Transfer, incorporation of technological advancements in supply chain networks, supply chain complexity solutions, supply chain complexity drivers, sustainable supply chain networks, and capability to reduce supply chain complexity. The findings of this study highlight that process complexity significantly influences the process of knowledge transfer in food supply chain networks. The research findings contribute to both academic and practical domains. This study contributes to the aggregation of supply chain complexity and its impact on Knowledge Transfer. Additionally, the findings support supply chain networks, which strive to achieve efficient Knowledge Transfer to attain sustainable value in business operations. Conclusion: This study has proven that robust knowledge transfer reduces supply chain complexity as it makes supply chain systems more resilient and well-coordinated in many potential ways. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background: In the pursuit of sustainable energy sources, residual biomass has emerged as a promising renewable resource. However, efficiently managing residual biomass poses significant challenges, particularly in optimizing supply chain operations. Advanced modeling approaches are necessary to address these complexities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive methodological framework for creating simulation models tailored to agroforestry residual biomass supply chains. Methods: The study employs a hybrid simulation approach, integrating geographic information system mapping with a case study analysis. The simulation was conducted over a 365-day period, using the anyLogistix software (version 2.15.3.202209061204) to model various supply chain dynamics. The framework also accounts for financial, operational, customer satisfaction, and environmental metrics. Results: The simulation results showed a total expenditure of EUR 5,219,411.3, with transportation being the primary cost driver, involving 5678 trips and a peak capacity of 67.16 m3. CO2 emissions were measured at 487.7 kg/m3. The model performed as expected, highlighting the need for sustainable logistics strategies to reduce costs, lower losses, and improve productivity. Conclusions: This study presents one of the first detailed methodological frameworks for simulating agroforestry residual biomass supply chains. It provides valuable managerial insights into the financial, operational, and environmental aspects of supply chain management. The findings may stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance the sustainability of biomass utilization in energy production. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {In order to improve the efficiency of online consumption and supply chain efficiency of fresh agricultural products in the e-commerce environment, a network node layout optimization algorithm was designed. In the e-commerce environment, a network node deployment model has been constructed for the online consumption behavior of fresh agricultural products. A network transmission supply chain detection model was established through the rotation scheduling method. By combining distributed transformation protocols, the spatial layout characteristics of network nodes have been reorganized. Further introduction of a multi-coverage scheduling model, combined with sensor information fusion tracking technology, accurately detects the layout characteristics of network nodes. Based on these detection data, forwarding and adaptive control protocols were developed. Real-time control using the node traversal method was developed. Under the optimal node supply chain transmission mechanism, the scheduling of the network node layout has been achieved. Meanwhile, convolutional neural networks were utilized to dynamically adjust layout control to ensure convergence and stability. The simulation results show that the node forwarding ability of the network node layout design for online consumption behavior of fresh agricultural products in the e-commerce environment is good, which improves the output balance of the network supply chain transmission of online consumption behavior of fresh agricultural products in the e-commerce environment. In addition, the optimized delivery cost decreased by 20% compared to before optimization, delivery efficiency increased by 30%, and inventory turnover rate increased by 25%, confirming that the proposed method has good optimization performance. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Multi-channel network supply chains are functionally and organizationally more advanced, meet the requirements of the modern market as much as possible, and allow you to form an adequate product offer in the network of relevant supply and sales channels. However, the more complex the structure of the supply chain, the higher the degree of its internal connectivity and interdependence, and the more it is exposed to uncontrollable events and, accordingly, failures or rejections. The ramifications and complexity of agricultural products supply chain increase attention to their reliability and the need to develop new methods and models for maintaining and ensuring the necessary level of reliability of the supply chain of agricultural products, especially in today’s difficult geopolitical conditions.The article discusses approaches to the formation of a multi-level model of structural reliability of the supply chain. It proposes a scheme for its assessment, which quantitatively describes the state of stability of the supply chain in the event of the spread of failures and rejections. An outsourcing planning model has been studied, in which the task of forming a supply chain food turns into the task of selecting channels with the lowest costs, provided that the requirements for reliability are met. The calculations show that multi-channel (network) supply chains for agricultural products with backup channels provide increased reliability, stability, and recoverability. A series-parallel model of structural reliability has been proposed, which ensures the flexibility of the supply chain with given reliability due to the possibility of regulating the volume of supplies by channels. © 2024 by the author(s).},

In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like “emotion magnitude” and “emotion interaction”. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical.

However, some fires occur due to negligent attitudes towards fire, which is often used to remove agroforestry leftovers. In addition to the fire risk, this burning also represents a waste of the energy present in this residual biomass. Both rural fires and energy waste affect the three dimensions of sustainability. The ideal solution seems to be to use this biomass, avoiding the need for burning and recovering the energy potential. However, this process is strongly affected by logistical costs, making this recovery unfeasible. In this context, this study aims to propose an optimization model for this chain, focusing on the three dimensions of sustainability. The results of the present study comprise a summary of the current state of the art in supply-chain optimization, as well as a disruptive mathematical model to optimize the residual biomass supply chain. To achieve this objective, a literature review was carried out in the first phase, incorporating the specificities of the context under study to arrive at the final model.

   abstract = {As environmental sustainability gains importance, enhancing supply chains to minimize environmental hazards is essential, particularly in industries using residual biomass. This study tackles this by investigating the integration of sustainability criteria into supply chain optimization for a biomass energy company in Portugal, using a combination of simulation modeling through anyLogistix software (version: 2.15.3.202209061204) and multi-criteria decision-making. Four supply chain scenarios were designed and simulated, differing in their number of distribution centers, the adoption of green logistics, and split-by-ratio distribution strategies over a 305-day period. Through the weighted sum model, Scenario C emerged as the optimal configuration, achieving a balance between operational efficiency and sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% and lowering transportation costs without compromising revenue. Sensitivity analysis further highlighted the trade-offs between cost efficiency, lead times, and environmental impact, showing that the strategic placement of distribution centers and the use of eco-friendly vehicles significantly improve the sustainability of the biomass supply chain. These findings provide practical insights for decision-makers, demonstrating how digital modeling tools can enhance supply chain management by optimizing environmental and operational goals simultaneously. This research contributes to the fields of sustainable logistics and supply chain management by validating the effectiveness of green logistics strategies and multi-criteria decision-making approaches in reducing environmental impact while maintaining economic viability. © 2024 by the authors.},

This food bank has compiled a rich dataset of connections between supply chain partners (e.g., donors), the flow of stock (volume of food), and their beneficiary organisations. Our analysis showed an increase in the system's 'moving parts' (increased handling of donations), resulting in a significant imbalance between supply and demand. Additionally, in 2022, the organisation's warehouses received a larger number of smaller-volume donations from a wider variety of suppliers, placing an extra burden on the network.},

   abstract = {Background: This study investigates the vital significance of logistical cost optimization within the residual woody biomass supply chain, aiming to boost both sustainability and the efficient uti-lization of this resource. There is an emphasis on how adept cost management can determine the economic feasibility of exploiting residual biomass. Methods: The research delves into crucial areas including collection, transportation, storage, and processing of biomass, highlighting their re-spective roles in the total cost. The influence of factors such as seasonality and biomass quality variations on the supply chain's cost and efficiency is explored. To provide an in-depth analysis of these factors, mathematical models are presented that allow for the examination of a variety of scenarios and optimization strategies. Techniques such as linear programming, genetic algo-rithms, and tabu search are contextualized within these models. Results: The study provides in-sights into individual cost contributions of different logistical operations. It also reveals how seasonality and biomass quality variations directly affect the cost and efficacy of the supply chain. Conclusions: Proficient logistical cost management is crucial for the successful exploitation of re-sidual biomass. The findings have substantial implications for managing the residual biomass supply chain, paving the way for a transition to a low-carbon economy. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The traditional performance evaluation method, which is mainly based on financial indexes, is no longer applicable to the current dynamic, complex, and coordinated evaluation of the service quality of fresh agricultural produce supply chains. Comprehensive evaluations regarding the quality of coordination-based supply chain services are now required. Specific analyses of index weights, the identification of potential problems, the exploration of the best solutions, and efforts to improve the current situation—regarding the circulation of fresh agricultural products—are also required. By carrying out this research, this paper aims to construct a coordination-based service quality evaluation index system for the fresh agricultural produce supply chain platform. The evaluation system that was created covered the four dimensions involved in platform supply chain coordination. These dimensions are capital flow, logistics, business flow, and information flow. On this basis, this study designed a survey questionnaire to collect data to evaluate customer service quality satisfaction. The research used AHP and the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method to calculate and analyze indexes and models in the “Fresh Networking” project. Furthermore, this paper proposed a sensitivity analysis model of MCDM evaluation indexes and their weights. In order to verify whether the numerical analysis method was suitable for use in the MCDM evaluation system, in this paper, the sensitivity analysis process of the indexes and their weights was introduced in the evaluation of the “Fresh Networking” project. The evaluation results may reflect the real quality of service in the “Fresh Network” supply chain. The final conclusion to be drawn from this paper is that capital flow is the most sensitive weight, which means that it should be designed and implemented in accordance with optimization-based decisions. The novelty of this paper lies in: (1) the proposal of a coordination-based service quality evaluation index system which includes four dimensions: capital flow, logistics, business flow, and information flow; (2) the design of a research questionnaire for data collection; and (3) the introduction of an improved sensitivity analysis method for the MCDM index. The results presented in this paper will enrich the theoretical research related to MCDM in supply chain evaluations. The results of the analysis can be used to guide supply chain decision makers to make optimization decisions accordingly, which will ensure overall benefits in terms of supply chain coordination, improving the capacity of preservation services, and loss reduction. © 2023 by the authors.},

Alternatives to global food systems, generally referred to as alternative food systems, emphasise trust through local and short food initiatives, commonly referred to as alternative food networks. Alternative food networks can benefit from the trust characteristics inherent in digital technology advances such as blockchain. A key characteristic of blockchain is trust. Knowing how blockchain trust characteristics and trust mechanisms can be used to facilitate trust in the supply chains of alternative food networks will be helpful. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature and an understanding of how trust is captured in architectures of blockchain-enabled food supply chains and highlights possible extensions towards facilitating trust in the supply chain of alternative food networks. A distinction is made between the trust characteristics inherent in blockchain and those that apply to alternative food network supply chains. A framework to integrate trust enabled by blockchain into supply chains of alternative food networks is proposed. Areas of future work are recommended, including a need to validate the proposed framework. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We develop a game-theoretic framework of a network supply chain structure. The study shows that (a) the manufacturer is better off while the retailer is worse off when the retailer shares his private information with the manufacturer; (b) the equilibrium greening levels are the highest when both the manufacturers are informed; (c) under intense competition, the retailer has an incentive to share the information with the manufacturer; (d) the equilibrium greening levels decrease with information inaccuracy. This study shows the existence of a contracting mechanism the manufacturers can employ to induce information sharing. This study’s results will be helpful to managers of green supply chain structures to make marketing and operational decisions under uncertain situations. The main contribution of this study is that it explores the problem of information sharing in a green supply chain under competition. © The Authors 2023, CC BY-NC.},

   abstract = {The sustainability of supply chains has become one of the most important global issues depending on the UN 2030 vision. Considering that an estimated 80% of global trade is realised through supply chains, it will be sufficient for businesses to transform their supply chains into a more sustainable structure to impact the world positively. From this point of view, the way to achieve sustainability is through the trade perspectives of buyers and suppliers in global supply chains and value networks. Supply chains mainly include an upstream linear material flow where materials transform from raw material form to the final product and reach the end user. Still, they also include limited downstream product flows. On the other hand, the circular economy (CE) promises a business ecosystem where innovative business models are developed to ensure the efficient use of waste materials and to extend and redesign the useful life of products. From the point of view of supply chain professionals, prioritising suppliers that provide regenerated material in sourcing inputs required for manufacturing can be a key to the transition from a linear supply chain to a circular value chain. Undoubtedly, both ensuring the sustainability of operations and implementing the circular value chain approach require all businesses’ participation. Besides, the circular approach will require radical changes in the general linear supply chain processes “plan-source-make-deliver and return”. Return processes express the place of circular strategies in supply chain orthodoxy. In general, return operations are handled at the dyadic level, where a buyer and a seller usually handle the recycling, repair or remanufacturing of products. In this study, a research methodology approach that encompasses two phases was adopted. In the first phase, businesses with a circularity-oriented business model were subjected to an in-depth case study analysis. In the second phase, exploratory research was conducted on the supply chain managers of manufacturing companies operating in Turkey with an in-depth interview technique. The research aims to explore the circular strategies of manufacturing companies with a traditional linear supply chain structure. However, determining the perceptions of supply chain professionals regarding the concept of circular value chains is another aim of the research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

   abstract = {Queueing delays are ubiquitous in many domains, including computer systems, service systems, communication networks, supply chains, and transportation. Queueing and scheduling theory provide a rigorous basis for understanding how to reduce delays with scheduling, including evaluating policy performance and guiding policy design. Unfortunately, stateof- the-art theory fails to address many practical concerns. For example, scheduling theory seldom treats nontrivial preemption limitations, and there is very little theory for scheduling in multiserver queues. My thesis presents two new, broadly applicable tools that greatly expand the reach of scheduling theory, using each to solve multiple open problems. The first tool, called "SOAP", is a new unifying theory of scheduling in single-server queues, specifically the M/G/1 model. SOAP characterizes the delay distribution of a broad space of policies, most of which have never been analyzed before. Such policies include the Gittins index policy, which minimizes mean delay in low-information settings, and many policies with preemption limitations. The second tool, called "WINE", is a new queueing identity that complements Little's law. WINE enables a new method of analyzing complex queueing systems by relating them to simpler systems. This results in the first delay bounds for Shortest Remaining Processing Time (SRPT) and the Gittins policy in multiserver queues, specifically the M/G/k model. This abstract gives a brief overview of my thesis, describing what the SOAP and WINE tools do, the key ideas underlying them, and the open problems they help solve.  © 2023 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

When two companies engage in business as a buyer and a supplier, they form a buyer-supplier relationship. That is a dyad-two entities linked in a relationship. Yet, triads are the smallest unit where we can begin to observe network dynamics. A common triad in supply networks is the buyer-supplier-supplier relationship. If we extend the supplier-supplier relationship horizontally, we get a supply base to a buying company. If we extend the buyer-supplier relationship vertically, we see an extended supply chain. If we combine the supply bases and extended supply chains, we end up with supply networks. Using the network concepts and theories, we study the structural and behavioral patterns of supply networks. Further, using the theoretical lens of complex adaptive systems, we examine the dynamic and evolutionary patterns of supply networks. By doing so, we consider how to help make supply networks become more resilient and robust. © Thomas Y. Choi 2023.},

The results indicated that time can negatively affect the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. So, the effect of time and delays should be considered in the BWE score. There are two modes: (1) the RBWE occurs at this interval, where the proposed network was able to regulate and control the RBWE; (2) the RBWE does not occur at this interval, where the stability area was obtained to ensure that the manager can change the inputs or outputs according to his policies, in this area with no regard to the occurrence of the RBWE.

   abstract = {Performance Measurement Supply chain is a challenge for every fresh meat industry. Providing timely performance reports across all components is very important, considering that performance reports are a benchmark for customer orders. The purpose of this study is to create a performance appraisal information system model using SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) to meet the requirements of customers or industry players along the fresh beef supply chain. This study uses a modeling framework and business process notation (BPMN) based on Rapid Application Development (RAD). This research will integrate this required model process with a cloud-based front-end with SCOR-based database operations connected to mobile and desktop networks. Supply chain performance will be visualized and display the performance measurements' results into graphs, histograms, and line charts.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Alternative food networks (AFNs) have the potential to enhance and redistribute value in favour of producers and consumers through novel ways of organizing supply chain activities. What is more, AFNs are often characterized by their ‘sustainability promise’ – or the idea that their networks foster social, ecological or environmental improvements over conventional food networks. Based on a purposive sample of 286 producers across five Swedish AFNs (i.e. community supported agriculture, REKO-rings, farmers’ markets, farm stores and food nodes), we explore how differences in how supply chain activities are managed and relate them to profitability, fair wages, cooperation, logistics efforts, happiness and future beliefs. Using a combination of correlation analysis, linear regression and means comparisons, we challenge the notion that AFNs achieve their sustainability promise or enhance value through novel combinations of supply chain activities. Our findings include several key differences in how supply chain management (SCM) activities are organized across AFNs and their variant importance for profitability. Moreover, we find significant differences in happiness across AFNs that are better explained through beliefs about the future than profitability or fair wages. By exploring happiness and profitability, we offer insights into why some AFN actors thrive despite poor economic returns. © 2021. Hunter et al.},

   abstract = {We study a novel economic network (supply chain) comprised of wire transfers (electronic payment transactions) among the universe of firms in Brazil (6.2 million firms). We construct a directed and weighted network in which vertices represent cities and edges connote pairwise economic dependence between cities. Cities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location, and links denote intercity wire transfers. We find a high degree of economic integration among cities in the trade network, consistent with the high degree of specialization across Brazilian cities. We identify cities with a dominant role as customers and suppliers to the entire supply chain using centrality network measures. The supply-chain network has a disassortative mixing pattern, which is explained by the heterogeneity in the size of Brazilian municipalities. We find that the supply-chain network becomes more disassortative during adverse times, such as the Brazilian recession in 2014 and the global financial crisis. We use entrepreneurship data and show that one potential driver of this change is the death of small firms, leading to a greater concentration of economic flows in larger centers. Our results suggest that adverse events significantly impact the supply-chain network with meaningful and heterogeneous economic consequences across municipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts’ efficiency plays a dual role. From the customer perspective, it may reduce contractual frictions and increase economic transactions between cities. From the supplier perspective, cities that are central suppliers to the supply chain may use courts’ inefficiency as a lawsuit barrier from their customers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management.  © 2022 Ali Rizwan et al.},

   abstract = {Background: Supply chains are the networks linking sources of supply with demand points and composed of so-called actors, i.e., producers, distributors/wholesalers, retailers, and customers/consumers. As in every network, supply chains contain vertices and arcs, the former represented by factories and warehouses (including distribution centers). Such facilities cause long-term and expensive investments. As a result, decisions on location and number of them belong to the strategic level of management and require quantitative analysis. To do this, mathematical models of the Facility Location Problem (FLP) are constructed to allow an application of optimization methods. Methods: Mathematical optimization or programming is the selection of the best solution, with regard to some criterion, from a set of feasible alternatives. The fundamental of mathematical optimization is the formulation of mathematical models of analyzed problems. Mathematical models are composed of objective function, decision variables, constraints, and parameters. These components are presented and compared in the paper concerning FLP from a supply chain perspective. Results: The ten mathematical models of the FLP are presented, including the two original ones. The models are classified according to such features as facility type they concern, including the desirable, neutral, and undesirable ones. The models and their components are characterized. In addition, their applicability and elasticity are analyzed. Finally, the models are compared and discussed from the supply chain point of view. Conclusions: However, the FLP mathematical models are relatively similar; the most important element of them for supply chain appropriate representation is an objective function. It strongly influences the possible applicability of FLP models and their solutions, as well. The objective functions having broader applicability turned out to be the maximized number of supply/demand points covered by facilities and the minimized number of facilities necessary to cover supply/demand points. However, not to locate all allowed facilities (use all the location sites) or as many as supply/demand points, but an appropriate number of them, it is necessary to take into account facility fixed costs. Thus, when locating logistics facilities, the minimized total cost of serving supply/demand points is the most appropriate objective function. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska.},

   abstract = {The current approaches to estimating the level of energy security are based on applying a comprehensive approach to selecting the factors that affect energy security and the dynamics of processes in this domain. This article reveals the application of the model of energy security estimation and strategizing based on the systemic description of energy security as an object of management: the integral system, elements and connections, functions, processes, and the system’s material. At the same time, this model is able to take into account the dynamics of technological, political, economic, and other factors operating in the country and on the global arena. The energy security estimation model developed uses a modern methodology of integrated estimation: a multiplicative form of the integrated index, a formalized definition of the safe existence limits in order to provide scientific substantiation of the threshold vector, a modified rationing method, the principal components method, and the sliding matrix method to substantiate dynamic weighting coefficients. The paper demonstrates the systemic approach application to shaping strategic goals in the energy security domain in the context of sustainable development; the trajectory of energy security development is calculated by the method of strategizing that applies the principle “future is determined by the trajectory to the future” instead of the classical forecasting “past determines the future”. In general, the article shows the possibility of unifying the process of formalizing energy security (according to the needs of the researcher: country, industry, energy network, supply chain) as an object of management, estimating energy security status, and strategizing the regulatory sphere transformation in accordance with the target values for monitoring the effectiveness of management. © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Many current supply chains have not been designed to take into account the concept of risk, the possibility of applying some risk evaluation methods and the connection of this risk with vulnerability and resilience. For the different topologies of a chain, two objectives must be considered essential when designing a chain or a network supply chain: efficiency (minimization of costs) and effectiveness (maximization of service quality). But facing the risk inherent in the different stages of the chain should also be considered. Moreover, many businesses are working to satisfy the demands of different customer profiles (e.g., industrial and private or on-line and face-to-face). These businesses are managing chains addressed to two or more sets of customers. This is the case of distribution in the pharmaceutical sector, in which there are, broadly speaking, pharmacy and public administration clients. This work aims to further discuss the identification and evaluation of risks for the redesign of a set of chains or a network. This broader view means that risk management is incorporated when designing the flows. Synergistic multi-business chains contribute to better decision-making, as each customer profile is considered both separately and with the rest. A better supply chain performance is expected in this further context of risk management. The risks in multi-business synergistic chains include aspects integrated into different variables referring to the quantitative elements by nature, such as costs and times. They should also reflect qualitative ones, such as the configuration of the chain and its consequences on vulnerability and resilience. Finally, as an example, the proposed methodology is applied to supply chains of the same distribution business in the pharmaceutical sector in Chile. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Three different perspectives are proposed to explore how specialized crops and activities transformed farming and regional organization. Firstly, the pioneering historical work on alternative agricultures by Joan Thirsk serves to compare various definitions and approaches to specialization from the production side. Secondly, the article questions how changes in commercial networks, supply chain and industrial activities can shape the spatial footprint of the specialized rural systems. Thirdly, these systems become the fieldwork for observing the contemporary dynamics of agricultural intensification, technical rationalization, and socio-economic selection. © 2021 Centro de Estudios Historico-Rurales.

The state is the second largest producer of tomatoes in the country and contributes to almost 90% of the domestic winter tomato supplies. However, tomato farmers in Florida have come under increasing pressure due to climate changes, foreign imports, and rising production costs. The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether Florida tomato growers will continue to sustain their production given the seasonal and geographic production advantage, yet against various internal and external threats emerging throughout the fresh produce supply chain. We developed our study on a multi-disciplinary conceptual model of network (supply chain) relationship and primary and secondary data gathered from various stakeholders and the literature. We found that Florida farmers have done remarkably well by adapting to warming temperatures and changing consumer expectations about environmental sustainability and responsible labor practices. However, foreign competition, labor shortage, the rising costs of inputs, extreme weather events (hurricanes), and pests and diseases due to humid climate continue to affect the sustainability of the Florida tomato production. Our paper suggests various farm-, market-, and institution-level adaptation mechanisms for preventing the regional production advantage of the Florida tomato industry from eroding. Newer immigration laws are necessary for easing the labor situation. In order to have a level playing field with respect to the use of protected agriculture technology such as in Mexico and Canada, U.S. farmers in general and Florida farmers in particular need government support. Florida farmers need to diversify their fresh produce market strategies, finding new product streams. There is also a need for reforming the product certification landscape, which some growers find cumbersome and cost prohibitive. Growers may gain from being better able to convey to consumers the information regarding their effort put into environmental sustainability, workers welfare, and safe food.},

   abstract = {Supply chain sustainability (SCS) is an approach that takes into consideration the environmental, economic, and social aspects of the supply chain processes, components, technologies, and logistics when designing a supply chain network. The elements that impact SCS encompass all kinds of waste, emissions, green management, workers’ health and well-being, market competitiveness, transportation, and financial aspects of the network. Supply chain experts should integrate sustainability practices in different phases of the supply chain and encourage organizations to orient their efforts toward designing sustainable supply chains. In this study, we present a new metric, “supply chain sustainability index (SCSI)” to assess the overall sustainability of a biomass supply chain network through three criteria: environmental, social, and economic sustainability. To pursue the objective of the study, a Bayesian Network approach is implemented to depict the causal relationship among different variables and to demonstrate a better analysis of the subject. For further assessment and analysis of the overall sustainability of the supply chain network, sensitivity analysis and belief propagation are performed. Results indicate that all three criteria are imperative to SCSI prediction; however, economic sustainability has a slightly higher effect among the three criteria, while social criteria have the lowest effect on SCSI.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, biomass is used for less than 0.1% to produce biodiesel because of the higher process complexity and costs with respect to fossil fuel feedstock. There is a need for innovative and breakthrough technologies which makes the use of biomass for producing biodiesel competitive. CONVERGE project aims to validate an innovative process for advanced biodiesel production that is more efficient and less expensive than current technologies, making it competitive with fossil fuels. The present paper defines the criteria to set up case scenarios of low-carbon, resource-efficient and sustainable residual biomass supply chains suitable for the commercial application of CONVERGE technology in Scandinavian, Central European, Mediterranean and Hanseatic regions. Scandinavia and Central Europe have regions with the highest bioeconomic potentials which allow mono-feedstock supply chains and high capacity of the CONVERGE technology. The Mediterranean and Hanseatic regions have usually lower bioeconomic potential and only locally there are optimal conditions of supply. In these districts the most promising scenarios should rely more on not feedstock-specific production plants, on feedstock imports, or switching feedstock use from heat/power to biofuel applications. Moreover in these districts multifeedstocks supply chains consisting in the integration of different kinds of biomass are strongly recommended. © 2020, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

This article therefore attempts to answer the research question of how environmental uncertainty within a firm’s supply chain, impacts firm financial performance. We further evaluate the role of supply chain risk management practices in mitigating the negative impact of such disruption events. To answer the research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using both primary and secondary data. The results show that environmental uncertainty has a negative impact on firm financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism mediating the impact. However, organisations that adopt macro and network supply chain risk management practices are able to improve managerial decision making frame, and mitigate the negative impact of environmental uncertainty on firm financial performance.

   abstract = {Within assembly network supply chains, supply disruptions can occur on every supplier-buyer link. Managing this network unreliability can help to reduce schedule instability and increases the overall efficiency of the supply chain accordingly. In this line, a stylised assembly network supply chain model is proposed with two suppliers and a single buyer using the joint economic lot sizing approach. This supply network can be disrupted by a shortage occurring at one of the two suppliers due to random machine breakdowns, which consequently creates dependent requirements variations affecting both the buyer and the entire network. First, the basic joint economic lot sizing model is extended by the said schedule instability. Second, a solution approach is presented concerning the determination of optimal lot sizes, the investment into the reliability of the supply network as well as the determination of safety stocks. Furthermore, the sensitivity of relevant model parameters is investigated by means of a numerical example. Managerial implications are accordingly derived focusing on the reliability of the supply network members and internal incentive structures. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

The authors show that boundary spanners engage in identity work from a particular position of liminality where the tensions of identity become amplified. Hence, in their identity work, boundaries oscillate as they seek to define who counts as 'the other'; and different identity levels are juxtaposed and particular characteristics activated to legitimize their role. The picture emerges of incoherence and irresolution in identity work as central to interactions across organizational boundaries. Nevertheless, the literature also regards the construction of identity as critical to effective performance in inter-organizational relationships and to how the employing organization is positioned in a variety of networks. This identity work is, therefore, fundamental to opportunities and constraints available to the organization. Important and consequential questions about the role of identity in power and agency are thus emerging. © Oxford University Press 2020.},

It is imperative to find effective ways to manage freight systems with smart transportation solutions so that governments can facilitate policy decisions to use their resources more efficiently. To make such concrete policy decisions for a specific study region, freight network, supply chain, and freight transportation trends should be studied carefully. As such, this study evaluates the accessibility of freight warehouses to intermodal freight facilities using Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based tools with a focus on Value of Time (VOT), spatial distributions of warehouses and intermodal freight facilities, and traffic characteristics. A Value of Freight Accessibility (VoFA) metric is developed for traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the Tampa Bay region as a function of accessibility to warehouses, number of trucks, and VOT. Results indicate that there is a need for smart transport solutions such as dedicated truck-only lanes, and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) in order to help decrease the travel time needed for freight transportation and increase the freight accessibility. Findings are critical in terms of informing Florida transportation agencies to pinpoint freight bottleneck areas and enhance their freight transportation plans and policies to alleviate these bottlenecks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

BT is defined as a database that registers digital assets in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. Organisations have tested many BT applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, the literature is still nascent as to how BT reduces the risk in supply chains.

The DCMNDP requires the installation of at most one facility on each edge that allows routing the multicommodity flow demands in order to minimize the sum of the fixed facility installation costs. To solve the DCMNDP to optimality, we have tailored a Benders decomposition based procedure that we apply to two different formulations, namely the widely used arc-flow based formulation and the arc-path based formulation. This latter formulation is characterized by an exponential number of variables whose resolution requires the use of column generation as well as cut generation algorithms. An experimental computational study is conducted on real-world instances to compare the performance of the proposed formulations.

Customers' review of records costs and customer satisfaction and its relationship with shortage and inventory holding are the objective functions. The customer satisfaction increased by decreasing inventory holdings and shortage amount. The goal is to determine the delivery quantities to customers taking account of shortage and inventory holding amount per period.

To minimize the overall cost of a complex supply chain network, supply chain network is firstly transformed into a user equilibrium problem. Then, to address uncertainty along the link, the cost of each link is modelled as a fuzzy number. The original Physarum model is modified to obtain the flux of each link under fuzzy link cost condition. Compared with other Physarum-inspired methods, the proposed method can deal with fuzzy link cost in supply chain networks, which is a common circumstance in real applications. The experiment results of the numerical example demonstrate the convergence, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Old City Publishing, Inc.},

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize peer reviewed articles published in the area to develop a con-ceptual framework and to aid future research. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper adopted a systematic review of literature on innova-Tion capability. The final screening generated 51 articles from 30 journals from 2000-2015. Findings: The examination and synthesis of the theoretical and the empirical articles show that (1) the authors applied narrow range of conceptual and theoretical foundations; (2) innovation capability is being investigated mostly at the firm level for about 90% of the articles, and margin-Ally about 5% at network (supply) chain level; (3) the authors define innovation capability in different ways and use diverse set of dimensions to measure innovation capability; (4) there is potential for future research across firms in innovation management disciplines. Practical implications: The review contributes to theory development in organizational capabil-ity literature in general. Managers wishing to innovate need to examine critically and integrate some of the innovation capability dimensions proposed in this paper. Originality: The review is unique in the sense that it provides conceptualisation of innovation capability framework.},

   abstract = {Big Data systems are often confronted with storage and processingrelated issues. Nowadays, data in various domains is growing so enormously and so quickly that storage and processing are becoming the two key concerns in such large systems of data. In addition to the size, complex relationship within the data is making the system highly sophisticated. Such complex relationships are often represented as network of data objects. Parallel processing, external memory algorithms, and data partitioning are at the forefront of techniques to deal with the Big Data issues. This chapter discusses these techniques in relation to storage and processing of Big Data. The Big Data partitioning techniques, such as agglomerative approaches in particular, have been studied and reported. Network data partitioning or clustering is common to most of the network-related applications where the objective is to group similar objects based on the connectivity among them. Application areas include social network analysis, World Wide Web, image processing, biological networks, supply chain networks, and many others. In this chapter, we discuss the relevant agglomerative approaches. Relative advantages with respect to Big Data scenarios are also presented. The discussion also covers the impact on Big Data scenarios with respect to strategic changes in the presented agglomerative approaches. Tuning of various parameters of agglomerative approaches is also addressed in this chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Critical infrastructure (CI) modeling and analysis is a very challenging research topic. One of the most pressing issues is to find an effective representation for addressing the system vulnerabilities caused by interdependencies, which, if exploited, could result in nontrivial accident scenarios. Until now, this question has been tackled for different sector-specific infrastructures (electricity grid, telecommunications networks, supply chains, etc.), and very few generalizable analysis tools have been developed. However, all CI share some features that can be leveraged in order to build a common modeling framework. This paper identifies these common features, which it exploits to develop a modeling language: the infrastructure resilience-oriented modeling language (I®ML). I®ML is designed to facilitate the analysis of operational interdependencies among the infrastructure components and overall resilience, i.e., the ability of the infrastructure to withstand and recover under off-nominal (anomalous) conditions. A number of examples are used to illustrate the modeling concepts and highlight the analytical capability of I®ML. © 2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Coordination among supply chain (SC) members is essential to enhance its overall performance. The effect of various coordination mechanisms on SC performance is an area of research interest. In this study, two mechanisms 'price discount' and 'delay in payment' are used separately and simultaneously to coordinate a network SC under a simulated business environment. Discrete event simulation modelling is used to study the performance of the network SC in this study. Lost sale and backorder are the two cases simulated as most business has one of these. The results show that coordination improves the performance of the SC compared to non-coordination case and the simultaneous use of 'price discount' along with 'delay in payment' further enhances the SC surplus significantly compared to the individual use of either price discount or delay in payment. The extent of improvement in performance in each case is also reported, since this is very relevant for the decision maker who compares the effort to be taken and benefits that accrue before adopting a system. Sensitivity analysis has also been conducted. © Copyright 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Business concepts, however, such as customer value and other business dependencies cannot be tackled with technical specifications. As a consequence, interoperability and business models become difficult to keep aligned. To address this issue, this paper focuses on the interaction of business model research and developments in SVNs with the aim to investigate how the free value strategy delivered via the freemium model can be used for marketing supply chain SVNs. To facilitate this, an adaptation of Osterwalder's business model ontology is applied to a case study from the container management service industry. The research shows that a freemium model can provide the means to coordinate the business and technological dependencies of a supply chain SVN while actually promoting its real value and long-term monetisation.

Supply chain efficiencies have been the central theme of a focal organization in designing and implementing supply networks. Supply Chain and Supply chain Management have played a significant role in corporate efficiency and have attracted the attention of numerous academicians over the last few years. SCM is management of material and information flow in a supply chain to provide the highest degree of customer satisfaction at the lowest possible cost. The arrival of major global auto companies has galvanised the domestic sector into adopting Supply Chain best practices. This has enhanced competitiveness leading to a quantum growth in exports. However, the Indian automotive industry has to operate in an unique environment further posing challenges to the already complex automobile supply chain. Therefore, a need is felt to continually study supply chain practices in this sector from a contemporary, practitioner's viewpoint in order to identify key factors of differentiation which would ultimately provide competitive advantage. The present study seeks to understand the performance and the present status, complexities and challenges facing the select auto ancillary units in Coimbatore District. It examines trends such as visibility and innovation, collaboration and supply networks and evolving leadership roles impacting supply chain management and its effective performance. The results also will help further in providing greater understanding of the success factors that lead to successful implementation of SCM strategies to reduce supply chain wide costs and to improve customer service levels.},

However, despite the development and progress that has been achieved in recent years on systems and models for measuring and evaluating the performance of logistics networks, many companies are still using only traditional financial metrics to measure their performance, and their performance evaluation are fragmented along the logistic network, since it is not managed as a system, but as several independent measurement performance systems.

All of these characteristics suggest that many of the Lean tools could be used to foresee and mitigate risks, and even to react to unexpected events. In this paper we examine the most important lean tools and relate them to the variables that are changed by them.

Our approach consists of a partitioning strategy for incoming streams of trajectories in order to reduce the trajectory size and represent trajectories as strings. We mine frequent trajectories using a sliding windows approach combined with a counting algorithm that allows us to promptly update the frequency of patterns. In order to make counting really efficient, we represent frequent trajectories by prime numbers, whereby the Chinese reminder theorem can then be used to expedite the computation. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, almost all kind of electronic devices leave traces of their movements (e.g. smartphone, GPS devices and so on). Thus, the huge number of this "tiny" data sources leads to the generation of massive data streams of geo-referenced data. As a matter of fact, the effective analysis of such amounts of data is challenging, since the possibility to extract useful information from this peculiar kind of data is crucial in many application scenarios such as vehicle traffic management, hand-off in cellular networks, supply chain management. Moreover, spatial data streams management poses new challenges both for their proper definition and acquisition, thus making the overall process harder than for classical point data. In particular, we are interested in solving the problem of effective trajectory data streams clustering, that revealed really intriguing as we deal with sequential data that have to be properly managed due to their ordering. We propose a framework that allow data pre-elaboration in order to make the mining step more effective. As for every data mining tool, the experimental evaluation is crucial, thus we performed several tests on real world datasets that confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

We approach this problem as that of mining for frequent sequential patterns. Our approach consists of a partitioning strategy for incoming streams of trajectories in order to reduce the trajectory size and represent trajectories as strings. We mine frequent trajectories using a sliding windows approach combined with a counting algorithm that allows us to promptly update the frequency of patterns. In order to make counting really efficient, we represent frequent trajectories by prime numbers, whereby the Chinese reminder theorem can then be used to expedite the computation. © 2013 ACM.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to analyze international and national research and development (R&D) programs and roadmaps for the manufacturing sector, presenting how agile and lean manufacturing models are addressed in these programs. Design/methodology/approach: In this review, several manufacturing research and development programs and roadmaps - national programs from the USA and Canada, and international programs from the European Union and from one international organization - are reviewed. Findings: The major finding of this review is that the main concerns in agile manufacturing, as highlighted in these programs, are networks, supply chain and product/service customization, and lean manufacturing's inclination towards achieving better cost efficiency. Although the lean manufacturing approach has been considered in many past and present programs, analysis of the most recent programs shows a greater priority is given to the agile manufacturing approach. The path towards sustainable manufacturing is delineated by pro-active attitude and action towards customers. Research limitations/implications: The study analyzes two national R&D programs from the USA, one international program from the European Union, three international roadmaps from the European Union, one business plan from Canada and one international roadmap from the global organization Intelligent Manufacturing Systems. Practical implications: The findings of this paper are intended to help managers, researchers and practitioners from the manufacturing sector to enhance their understanding and define suitable strategy for their organizations' sustainability and identify suitable manufacturing path with respect to agile and lean philosophies. This study could also help academics in defining course curricula for students more coherent with the R&D policies and/or requirements towards sustainable manufacturing with respect to agile and lean philosophies.

This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to evaluate a network supply chain operations considering economic and environmental factors. Carbon cap and credit are considered in the model. Multi-supplier, multi-plant, multi-product, and multi-customer zone problem environment is considered here. The model does a trade-off between logistic cost and GHG emission cost to determine the optimal flow of material through the supply chain. The model is demonstrated with a single product, multi-plant, multi-supplier and multi-demand zones example. This example shows that carbon emission is adding a considerable cost to total cost of the supply chain operations. © 2012 IEEE.},

Enterprises try to cooperate in different configurations enabling an increase in value added. Since the basic processes forming the usefulness of form, place and time are production operations and logistic processes, hence cooperation in these two task areas is increasingly essential. Therefore, subcontracting of production and logistic tasks is an essential factor determining the structure of contemporary supply chains which are called network chains. The resistance of network supply chains to disruptions is the same important exploratory area. Moreover, from the perspective of individual chain links forming a network supply chain, an essential issue is the skill of adapting itself to variable conditions of the environment and changes in the structure of the chain itself. The article took into consideration both of the exploratory areas: The resistance of network supply chains to disruptions and adaptive strategies of chain links in a supply chain.

Interest in decentralized control designs has been significantly renewed in recent years due to noteworthy extensions promised by the application of new results emerging in nonlinear robust and adaptive output-feedback control. In this vein, this chapter addresses the design of decentralized output-feedback controllers for a class of nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems based on our recent results on the dynamic high-gain scaling control design technique.

However, the literature includes little empirical evidence. This situation suggests the need to appraise investments in such networks or supply chains carefully. How can a decision maker reliably assess the effect of investing in inter-organizational network arrangements on firm value? This article takes up this issue and suggests a framework consisting of five components to help answer the question. The task of the framework is to support the structuring and revelation of the causal chain between investments in the network on the one hand and the effect of these investments on firm value on the other hand. The article develops and explains the framework in detail and later on relates extant literature to its components. A finding of this article is that potential causal chains from changes in a supply chain or supply network to firm value can be quite long and hypothetical. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to explore the links between organizational forms and human resource management. In recent years, many organizations have been seeking greater flexibility and agility, and as a result, they are relying more on market and market-like forms of coordination. The ways in which work contributions are brought together and are coordinated have thus become much looser and more variegated. Even the term ‘organization’ begins to seem too restrictive a concept to capture the variety of forms which the multiplicity of modes of coordinated work now takes. Externally, networks, supply chain management, various forms of contracting and outsourcing all tend to loosen the construct of a singular employing organization. Internally, we see a growing reliance on market-oriented projects, network structures, and process management approaches. Increasingly, cooperation runs alongside competition both within and between organizations. This admix of the principles of hierarchy, market and trust (Adler 2001:2670) leads not only to some interesting and novel forms but also throws up some novel human resource management challenges which have, to date, remained largely unexplored. © 2009 John Storey, Patrick M.

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose the first network performance measure that can be used to assess the efficiency of a network in the case of either fixed or elastic demands. Such a measure is needed for many different applications since only when the performance of a network can be quantifiably measured can the network be appropriately managed. Moreover, as we demonstrate, the proposed performance measure, which captures flow information and behavior, allows one to determine the criticality of various nodes (as well as links) through the identification of their importance and ranking. We present specific networks for which the performance/efficiency is computed along with the importance rankings of the nodes and links. The new measure can be applied to transportation networks, supply chains, financial networks, electric power generation and distribution networks as well as to the Internet and can be used to assess the vulnerability of a network to disruptions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {This paper considers network supply chains with price dependent demand by modelling them as large acyclic networks. Such large networks are common in the automobile and apparel industries. We develop a model to analyze the effect of these large-scale problems involving long sequences of contracts, and show that contract leadership, as well as leader position in the network, affect the performance of the entire supply chain. We generalize Spengler (Spengler, J. 1950. Vertical integration and anti-trust policy. J. Political Econom. 58 347-352) to a game on a "contract tree" for a particular supply chain and extend the concept of double marginalization so that it can be applied in the form of a transformation to each contract that is offered by one member to another in the "contract tree." We construct an algorithm to find the equilibrium solution, and derive the optimal location of the leader ("optimal" being the leader location that maximizes total supply chain profits). Our work formalizes many intuitive insights; for example, member profits are determined by systemwide rather than individual costs. Finally, we model Cournot competition between competing supply chains (both two heterogeneous trees and multiple identical trees) and show the effect of changes in leader position as well as cost structure on the equilibrium. © 2008 INFORMS.},

   abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the functionality of multistage programming approach on network supply chain structure. Design/methodology/approach - The general supply chain structure is considered and the supply chain planning model is developed using a two stage programming approach. The same model is extended to cover the applicability and advantages of a multi-stage programming approach. Findings - A multi-period supply chain model for new product launches under uncertain demand for supply chain network structure has been developed. The model allows simultaneous determination of optimum procurement quantity, production quantity across the different plants, transportation routes and the outsourcing cost in case of shortages. The proposed multi-stage model is compared with the standard two-stage model by examining the difference between the objective values of two solutions. The research clearly shows the importance of the multi-stage model as compared to the two-stage programming model. Research limitations/implications - The models developed here are limited to covering demand uncertainty, whereas real supply chain exhibits different uncertainties like capacity, processing time, etc. This can be the future direction for extending the work. Practical implications - The model is very useful in designing and planning the supply chain in an uncertain environment. The model allows the adjustment of the production plan as time progresses and uncertainties become resolved. Originality/value - The model uses a scenario approach to address the supply chain planning problem for a supply chain network structure under an uncertain environment and compares the two-solution approach for a set of problems. Generally supply chain costs are in millions of dollars and the saving using multi-stage programming can be significant. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

   abstract = {Growing attention is being given to the problem of efficiently designing and operating reverse supply chain systems to handle the return flows of production wastes, packaging, and end-of-life products. Because the information that exists for these new reverse supply chains is limited, solution methodologies for solving strategic infrastructure of reverse production systems under uncertainty are critical to support effective business and government decision making. This paper presents a robust optimization algorithm for designing network infrastructure when uncertainty affects the outcomes of the decisions and decision makers are adverse to risk. This new algorithm for reverse production system can be effectively used in designing network infrastructure when the joint probability distributions of key parameters are unknown. The algorithm only requires the information on potential ranges and possible discrete values of uncertain parameters, which often are available in practice. The algorithm involves the use of bi-level programming, which represents the game between decision makers and the decision environment. The environment is allowed to choose its perturbations and the optimal solution for the set of parameters. Simultaneously, the current candidate robust solution is then allowed to respond by changing certain continuous decision values, such as its flows. This game is played for each iteration of the algorithm. This paper will also discuss many pre-processing and problem transformation procedures for improving the computational ability of the algorithm. The proof that the algorithm always terminates at an optimal robust solution in finite number of iterations is also provided. The approach can be generalized to the robust design of network supply chain systems with reverse production systems as one of their subsystems. The resultant system will tend to be more financially and operationally viable if properly planned, since even with the least favorable realization of the parameters, the system may still perform close to optimal levels. A case study has been developed that illustrates the approach for the design of a regional infrastructure to process used electronic equipment.},

   abstract = {The movement of activities earlier in the product development process, necessitates a re-examination of the total supply network. Supply chain literature has traditionally examined procurement and value-adding activities, without explicitly defining product development as part of these. The trend towards outsourcing design activities is bringing recognition for this process as part of the total supply network. The objective of this paper is to determine the degree of early supplier involvement (ESI) that exists between a multinational electronics company and its key suppliers, in terms of depth of integration, information exchange and buyer-supplier relationships. The paper provides insights into the strategic factors that affect the dynamics of the ESI process. Such insights are valuable in terms of gaining a greater understanding of how the ESI process is managed and determining the barriers to effective supplier integration. The research indicates that there are considerable impediments for those participants responsible for establishing and managing the implementation of ESI. A number of strategic insights are identified that explain the existence of the impediments to the ESI process. Finally, based upon the findings a number of lessons are highlighted for organisations considering the adoption of the ESI process. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In order to save individual virgin materials by recycling products, manufacturing companies must adopt new information technology to evaluate the environmental impact of their management. The transformative adoption of digital technology is referred to as digital transformation (DX) , and the DX technique can be used to digitalize reverse supply chain management strategies for environmental issues. Before the use of the DX technique for a reverse supply chain, a decision maker (DM) was not be able to know the material types of the end-of-life (EOL) products based on their status until they had been recycled. However, using the DX technique, the DM is able to understand EOL product data such as the number and the amount of each material within the EOL products in advance. Therefore, the usage of the DX technique enables the DM to design the reverse supply chain network not only environmentally-friendly but also economical. In applying DX to supply chain networks, supply chain managers must cut costs and evaluate environmental impacts. In order to balance environmental and economic concerns, the DM can design a reverse supply chain network using a solving method for multi-criteria decision making such as linear physical programming (LPP). Using the LPP algorithm, the DM can calculate a harmonized weight for objective functions with a trade-off relationship. This study designs a reverse supply chain network for indivi dual material recovery environmentally-friendly and economical by using LPP as one of the support methods in the era of DX. The academic contribution of this study is that the effect of objective functions for individual material types can be identified, and the practical contribution is that it enables us to find a reverse network solution based on individual materials being collected from EOL products recycled throughout numerical experiments with LPP.},
