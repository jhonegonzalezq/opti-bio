	abstract = {The global sustainability development mission of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is easy to suggest, but incredibly difficult to put into action. Fortunately, continuing reliance on green conversion technologies could effectively address business concerns of energy expenditures, ecological pollution, and fossil fuel depletion. To promote sustainable practices, many researchers and practitioners have put their hopes in the environment-friendly use of biomass. Biomass supply chain management, which contributes to saving the planet, societies, and costs, has a high potential for sustainable development. Besides, successful implementation of regulatory policies that incorporate tax and incentive strategies into decision-making processes has shifted biomass businesses toward greener practices. To this end, quantitative analytics propose primary tools in developing sustainability-driven decisions for biomass supply chains. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive classification of methodologies applied in this field which incorporate the role of policy mechanisms into managerial decisions. The current study conducts a systematic review of 450 peer-reviewed papers, where we apply a rule-governed content analysis approach that includes collecting, filtering, and categorizing the prior research in a reproducible manner. We also classify the collected materials using deductive and inductive approaches to determine various structural dimensions and associated analytic categories. In the context of biomass supply chain management, we provide evidence that energy crops and forest-based biomass are the most addressed biomass feedstock types in the existing literature, while municipal solid waste sources could be explored further in future research. Additionally, from a sustainability development perspective we show that the environmental pillar has attracted much more attention than the social aspect that accounts for job creation, safe workplace, food security, and consumer surplus. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The complexity of the energy systems onboard ships, combined with the different operating/weather conditions and the availability of cutting-edge technologies, makes analyses for improving the energy and environmental performances of ships time consuming and challenging. From this point of view, this article provides new criteria for the sustainable design and management of energy systems of existing or new ships. In particular, the impact of the adoption of organic Rankine cycle units, wet steam volumetric expanders, and single or double effect absorption chillers is here investigated. Two types of ships are examined as suitable case studies, evaluating the impact of each technology and their combinations by varying the shipping cruises. By using a dynamic simulation approach, potential savings and optimal solutions are assessed for different energy system layouts by also comparing their economic, energy and environmental impact performance. Results are reported in specific performance matrices for helping stakeholders in preliminary energy efficiency analyses. In particular, outcomes show that high cooling demands of ships in the Caribbean Sea enable primary energy savings close to 4.5 %, compared to 3.5 % in the Mediterranean Sea and 3 % in the North Sea. In the latter case, cooling needs can be almost fully balanced through the examined energy recovery technologies. Screw expanders integrate best in all operating conditions with short paybacks, whilst organic Rankine cycles (with electrical efficiency above 8%) are advantageous especially in cold climate routes. Benefits on environmental impact are significant, with avoided CO2 emissions around 6 kt/y, depending on the selected ship cruise. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {One of the most major agendas to mitigate climate change is the transition to low-carbon energy extraction. Furthermore, developing cutting-edge prototypes for wearable technology, innovative housing, transportation, telecommunications, sophisticated electronics, and other related technologies necessitates the use of clean and readily available energy sources, which has become a fundamental priority. Sentient beings (humans and wildlife) have a variety of biological, mechanical, and thermal energy sources. Using the energy from these sources might be a viable way to circumvent the increasing electricity demand. This study looks at a variety of low-carbon-emitting energy capture materials, methods, and approaches that have recently been applied for solar, wind, hydrogen, mechanoelectrical, and biological response. Furthermore, this article discusses the proven approaches for harvesting energy from human bodies for self-powered gadgets. We provide material considerations, system topologies, and functioning concepts for these power extractors, with an emphasis on low-carbon solutions. We investigate various power sources placed in or on pre-existing and anthropological models. We conclude the review by emphasising the significance of merging various energy extractors with cutting-edge circuitry, which provides a new foundation for developing creative designs for self-powered electronics in healthcare and textiles. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Waste production is growing in most communities due to population expansion. Given the stated issue, managing the Solid Waste (SW) created worldwide would be vital. Effective Waste Management (WM) is essential to preserving the environment and lowering pollution. It aids in resource preservation, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and ecosystem protection. Additionally, the promotion of public health and sanitation is significantly aided by WM procedures. This study presents an integrated procedure to enhance the operations of a WM network for recycling SW. We propose a mathematical model to find the optimal sustainable vehicle routes, allocation, and Sequence Scheduling (SS) problem in the recycling industry to reduce costs and CO2 emissions and increase job opportunities. The fundamental innovation of this work is considering waste-vehicle and waste-technology compatibility and Internet of Things (IoT) systems in the model to decrease CO2 emissions and identify compatible waste for recycling centers to produce more final products. An LP-metric and an Epsilon Constraint (EC) approach are used to solve the suggested model. By comparing the two approaches, we have found EC performs better in results and CPU time. As a result, various test problems of different sizes are offered. Accordingly, sensitivity analyses are recommended to assess the suggested model's effectiveness. Using vehicles compatible with waste reduces CO2 emissions. Utilizing IoT technology and optimization methods makes it feasible to save costs (20%), have a less destructive impact on the environment (36%), and ultimately increase the sustainability of the WM process. © 2024},

	abstract = {Integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) with renewable energy sources, including biomass, biofuels, engines, and solar power, can revolutionize the energy industry. Biomass and biofuels have benefited significantly from implementing AI and ML algorithms that optimize feedstock, enhance resource management, and facilitate biofuel production. By applying insight derived from data analysis, stakeholders can improve the entire biofuel supply chain-including biomass conversion, fuel synthesis, agricultural growth, and harvesting-to mitigate environmental impacts and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Furthermore, implementing AI and ML in combustion systems and engines has yielded substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and overall performance. Enhancing engine design and control techniques with ML algorithms produces cleaner, more efficient engines with minimal environmental impact. This contributes to the sustainability of power generation and transportation. ML algorithms are employed in solar energy to analyze vast quantities of solar data to improve photovoltaic systems' design, operation, and maintenance. The ultimate goal is to increase energy output and system efficiency. Collaboration among academia, industry, and policymakers is imperative to expedite the transition to a sustainable energy future and harness the potential of AI and ML in renewable energy. By implementing these technologies, it is possible to establish a more sustainable energy ecosystem, which would benefit future generations. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To address climate change and ensure energy security, biomass energy has become a popular renewable energy alternative to traditional fossil fuels. This study focuses on the strategic planning and tactical management problem of a regional biomass supply chain system with multiple feedstock and final products. A novel SVC-based data-driven robust optimization model is developed to provide the tradeoff solutions under uncertainties. Compared with the traditional robust optimization model, it can better depict the uncertain sets, reduce data redundancy, and provide less conservative strategies for decision makers according to their risk preferences. The proposed model is validated through a case study, Meizhou city in China. The results suggested the optimal investment scale and site for biorefineries and biomass power plants at the strategic planning level, as well as the feedstock supply network, inventory management, and production arrangement at the tactic management level. The optimal robust solutions can be derived by varying the envelope level of the uncertain sets. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the influences of the variations of key parameters. It is found that the produced bioethanol and electricity lack cost advantages in the current situation, even with a 30 % reduction in main cost parameters. Insufficient biomass yield may require extra capital investment to satisfy bioenergy demand but with a higher supply cost. Thus, a high and long-term subsidy is necessary to facilitate the sustainable development of biomass and the low-carbon transition of the energy sector. © 2024},

	abstract = {In recent years, there have been frequent cases of impact on the stable development of supply chain economy caused by uncertain events such as COVID-19 and extreme weather events. The creation, management, and impact coping techniques of the supply chain economy now face wholly novel requirements as a result of the escalating level of global uncertainty. Although a significant literature applies uncertainty analysis and optimization modeling (UAO) to study supply chain management (SCM) under uncertainty, there is a lack of systematic literature review and research classification. Therefore, in this paper, 121 articles published in 44 international academic journals between 2015 and 2022 are extracted from the Web of Science database and reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Bibliometric analysis and CiteSpace software are used to identify current developments in the field and to summarize research characteristics and hot topics. The selected published articles are classified and analyzed by author name, year of publication, application area, country, research purposes, modeling methods, research gaps and contributions, research results, and journals to comprehensively review and evaluate the SCM in the application of UAO. We find that UAO is widely used in SCM under uncertainty, especially in the field of decision-making, where it is common practice to abstractly model the decision problem to obtain scientific decision results. This study hopes to provide an important and valuable reference for future research on SCM under uncertainty. Future research could combine uncertainty theory with supply chain management segments (e.g., emergency management, resilience management, and security management), behavioral factors, big data technologies, artificial intelligence, etc. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Developing hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) has been recognized as the best sustainable method for responding to global energy shortages. Introducing biomass power as backup into the HRES enables the improvement of the reliability of HRES powered by 100% renewable energy. But, the motivation behind this integration has been ignored and has inspired this study. In this study, a Stackelberg-based biomass power trading framework was designed to express resource integration and business collaboration between solar, wind, and biomass power operators for uninterrupted power feed-in. Subsequently, a bi-level multi-objective dynamics optimization model was developed to simulate the interplay between stakeholders in a hybrid 100% renewable energy system for the equilibrium between system reliability, profit requirements, environmental benefits, and social value. Finally, the biomass power trading framework and optimization method were successfully simulated in solar–wind–biomass HRES in the Qianjiang area, Chongqing City. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The hybrid wind–solar–biomass renewable energy system could feed in power to the main grid around of 526 million kWh over the year, among which wind power contributes above 57%, and biomass power stations supply a quarter of the electricity. With 2.92% of unmet load rate, operators of HRES and biomass stations can improve their earnings by 0.02 and 0.06 CNY/per kWh compared to their actual operations, respectively. After the sensitivity analyses, valuable conclusions and suggestions about natural resource changes, power delivery strategies selection, and so on were drawn for reference by business operators and local authorities for the multi-dimensional sustainable development of HRES. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transformation to a resource-circular bio-economy offers a mechanism to mitigate climate change and environmental degradation. As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables derived from terrestrial, aquatic biomass and waste resources are expected to play significant roles over the next decades. This study provides an overview of potential biomass resources ranging from higher plant species to phototrophic microbial cluster, and their fundamental photosynthesis processes as well as biogeochemical carbon cycles involved in ecosystems. The review reflects empirical advances in conversion technologies and processes to manufacture value-added biorenewables from biomass and waste resources. The nexus perspective of resource-biorenewable-waste has been analysed to understand their interdependency and wider interaction with environmental resources and ecosystems. We further discussed the systems perspectives of biorenewables to develop fundamental understanding of resource flows and carbon cycles across biorenewable subsystems and highlight their spatial and temporal variability. Our in-depth review suggested the system challenges of biorenewable, which are subject to nonlinearity, variability and complexity. To unlock such system complexity and address the challenges, a whole systems approach is necessary to develop fundamental understanding, design novel biorenewable solutions. Our review reflects recent advances and prospects of computational methods for biorenewable systems modelling. This covers the development and applications of first principle models, process design, quantitative evaluation of sustainability and ecosystem services and mathematical optimisation to improve design, operation and planning of processes and develop emerging biorenewable systems. Coupling these advanced computational methods, a whole systems approach enables a multi-scale modelling framework to inherently link the processes and subsystems involved in biomass ecosystems and biorenewable manufacturing. Reviewing modelling advances, our study provides insights into the emerging opportunities in biorenewable research and highlights the frontier research directions, which have the potential to impact biorenewable sector sustainability. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, population growth and lifestyle changes have led to an increase in energy consumption worldwide. Providing energy from fossil fuels has negative consequences, such as energy supply constraints and overall greenhouse gas emissions. As the world continues to evolve, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and finding alternative energy sources becomes increasingly urgent. Renewable energy sources are the best way for all countries to reduce reliance on fossil fuels while reducing pollution. Biomass as a renewable energy source is an alternative energy source that can meet energy needs and contribute to global warming and climate change reduction. Among the many renewable energy options, biomass energy has found a wide range of application areas due to its resource diversity and easy availability from various sources all year round. The supply assurance of such energy sources is based on a sustainable and effective supply chain. Simultaneous improvement of the biomass-based supply chain's economic, environmental and social performance is a key factor for optimum network design. This study has suggested a multi-objective goal programming (MOGP) model to optimize a multi-stage biomass-based sustainable renewable energy supply chain network design. The proposed MOGP model represents decisions regarding the optimal number, locations, size of processing facilities and warehouses, and amounts of biomass and final products transported between the locations. The proposed model has been applied to a real-world case study in Istanbul. In addition, sensitivity analysis has been conducted to analyze the effects of biomass availability, processing capacity, storage capacity, electricity generation capacity, and the weight of the goals on the solutions. To realize sensitivity analysis related to the importance of goals, for the first time in the literature, this study employed a spherical fuzzy set-based analytic hierarchy method to determine the weights of goals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Climate change and other environmental consequences of socio-economic activities require a more sustainable and circular growth. At the same time, the limitation of the earth resource demands industries to improve resource efficiency and increase the rate of recycling of materials. There are several sustainable and circular alternatives that the industries may adopt. However, the question is that among these alternatives, which one should be selected for implementation for the highest sustainable and circular benefits. This study introduces a novel tool for assessing the sustainability and circularity of biomass-based energy supply chains, integrating multi-criteria decision-making methods with life cycle thinking approach. It evaluates five alternatives using a sustainability and circularity indicators, offering new insights into the deloyment of circular business models at companies in biomass-based energy supply chain. The tool is also applied to a specific rice straw supply chain in Italy, to assess the sustainability and circularity of five alternatives and outrank them. The results indicated that not all the alternatives are better in terms of supporting sustainable development and circular economy, compared to the baseline business model. In this supply chain, the extended lifetime for digestate from the aerobic digestion plant is the most ‘sustainable and circular’ alternative, while the capture of carbon dioxide from the same plant and its use for microalgae cultivation is the least ‘sustainable and circular’ alternative. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on different weighting sets during the assessment. It indicated that the priority of the decision makers can slightly change the outrank of the alternatives and the magnitude of the outranks. © 2024},

	abstract = {Integrating innovation and environmental responsibility has become important in pursuing sustainable industrial practices in the contemporary world. These twin imperatives have stimulated research into developing methods that optimize industrial processes, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness while mitigating undesirable ecological impacts. This objective is exemplified by the emergence of biochar derived from the thermo-chemical transformation of biomass. This review examines biochar production methods and their potential applications across various aspects of the iron and steel industries (ISI). The technical, economic, and sustainable implications of integrating biochar into the ISI were explored. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization are the most efficient methods for higher biochar yield (25–90%). Biochar has several advantages- higher heating value (30–32 MJ/kg), more porosity (58.22%), and significantly larger surface area (113 m2/g) compared to coal and coke. However, the presence of biochar often reduces fluidity in a coal-biochar mixture. The findings highlighted that biochar production and implementation in ISI often come with higher costs, primarily due to the higher expense of substitute fuels compared to traditional fossil fuels. The economic viability and societal desirability of biochar are highly uncertain and vary significantly based on factors such as location, feedstock type, production scale, and biochar pricing, among others. Furthermore, biomass and biochar supply chain is another important factor which determines its large scale implementation. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities to reduce emissions from BF-BOF operations by utilizing biochar technologies. Overall, the present study explored integrating diverse biochar production methods into the ISI aiming to contribute to the ongoing research on sustainable manufacturing practices, underscoring their significance in shaping a more environmentally conscious future. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Biomass, a renewable resource crucial for carbon neutrality, serves as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels by closing the carbon loop. The biotransformation of biomass into carbon–neutral fuels for bioenergy and bioelectricity plays a key role in addressing climate change. Recent advancements in biomass bioenergy management, carbon capture, and carbon-negative emission technologies have been pivotal in reducing atmospheric CO2. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has markedly enhanced these traditional models by optimizing the biomass supply chain, selecting optimal feedstocks, and refining the operation of bioenergy plants. This review delves into the recent applications of AI in biomass bioenergy, highlighting AI-driven decision-making systems that improve computing and reasoning techniques toward carbon neutrality. Our analysis reveals a wide array of AI techniques, including genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and supervised machine learning, which have been deployed across the biomass bioenergy value chain. Notable outcomes suggested that AI can reduce CO2 emissions by 5% to 10%, equivalent to 2.6 to 5.3 gigatons of CO2.

	abstract = {A thorough grasp of the underlying mechanisms of catalytic reactions is indispensable for furthering our understanding of chemical kinetics. However, traditional phenomenological models present certain difficulties, including the tendency to converge to local minima and a reliance on parameters that are difficult to measure, particularly in complex catalytic systems. These systems frequently comprise intricate feedstock compositions or catalyst structures that are challenging to anticipate through theory-driven approaches. This often results in the utilization of unrealistic models or the allocation of considerable computational resources. While traditional methods offer valuable insights, they are constrained by these challenges and the lack of robust uncertainty assessments. In view of these limitations, data-driven modeling, in particular through machine learning (ML), has emerged as a promising alternative in catalysis in the last five years. This review examines recent advancements in ML applications within the field of catalysis, encompassing a broad range of applications, including data generation, descriptor identification, and feature engineering. While the review takes a general perspective on ML in catalysis, particular attention is given to applications in chemical kinetics wherever relevant, recognizing the interconnection between reaction kinetics, catalyst design, reaction conditions, and reactor configurations. The discussion includes various ML models, including interpretable yet less flexible models and more complex black-box models, and considers their applications in catalysis. It also examines key factors in model selection, such as generalizability, computational efficiency, data quality, and interpretability. Finally, it outlines future directions for ML in catalysis, emphasizing how these technologies can further enhance the optimization, design, and improvement of catalytic systems. © 2025},

In this study, a novel methodology is proposed that combines advanced “hard path” technologies and “soft path” policy to facilitate an effective and sustainable waste-to-energy approach. Multiple tech-economic MSW cascaded systems were established and combined for MSW terminal treatment, and a subsidy policy was applied to waste source management. Furthermore, an MSW reverse supply chain (MSWRSC) was proposed that integrates waste source and end treatment management, and a multi-objective mixed-integer dynamic model was established to optimize the MSW treatment process by achieving cost control, carbon emission reduction, and job creation. A practical case study was then conducted to provide the analysis paradigm including the system deployment and facilities operation. Further, some important conclusions and suggestions are summarized for reference by the local government and facilities. Therefore, the methodology that combines the cascade treatment systems with policy instruments shows important theoretical and pragmatic significance for the multi-dimensional sustainable development of MSW management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biochar is found to possess a large number of applications in energy and environmental areas. However, biochar could be produced from a variety of sources, showing that biochar yield and proximate analysis outcomes could change over a wide range. Thus, developing a high-accuracy machine learning-based tool is very necessary to predict biochar characteristics. In this study, a hybrid technique was developed by blending modern machine learning (ML) algorithms with cooperative game theory-based Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis was employed to help improve interpretability while offering insights into the decision-making process. In the ML models, linear regression was employed as the baseline regression method, and more advanced methodologies like AdaBoost and boosted regression tree (BRT) were employed. The developed prediction models were evaluated on a battery of statistical metrics, and all ML models were observed as robust enough. Among all three models, the BRT-based model delivered the best prediction performance with R2 in the range of 0.982 to 0.999 during the model training phase and 0.968 to 0.988 during the model test. The value of the mean squared error was also quite low (0.89 to 9.168) for BRT-based models. SHAP analysis quantified the value of each input element to the expected results and provided a more in-depth understanding of the underlying dynamics. The SHAP analysis helped to reveal that temperature was the main factor affecting the response predictions. The hybrid technique proposed here provides substantial insights into the biochar manufacturing process, allowing for improved control of biochar properties and increasing the use of this sustainable and flexible material in numerous applications. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Unsustainable production and consumption are driving a significant increase in global electronic waste, posing substantial environmental and human health risks. Even in more developed nations, there is the challenge of low collection rates. In response, we integrate offline and online trading systems and design a material efficiency strategy for used cell phones. We propose a new multi-objective optimization framework to maximize profit, carbon emissions reduction, and circularity in the process of recycling and treatment. Considering multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon features, as well as price sensitive demand, incentives, and qualities, we established a new multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization model. An enhanced, Fast, Non-Dominated Solution Sorting Genetic Algorithm (ASDNSGA-II) is developed for the solution. We used operational data from a leading Chinese Internet platform to validate the proposed optimization framework. The results demonstrate that the reverse logistics network designed achieves a win–win situation regarding profit and carbon emission reduction. This significantly boosts confidence and motivation for engaging in recycling efforts. Online recycling shows robust profitability and carbon reduction capabilities. An effective coordination mechanism for pricing in both online and offline channels should be established, retaining offline methods while gradually transitioning towards online methods. To increase the collection rate, it is essential to jointly implement a transitional strategy, including recycling incentives and subsidy policies. Additionally, elevating customer environmental awareness should be viewed as a long-term strategy, mitigating the cost of increasing collection rates during the market maturity stage (high collection rates). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

The study is conducted for three regions in the Punjab, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh, the states of India, respectively for the monsoon and winter seasons. Remarkably, 33 % increased bioenergy production value, and up to 92 % reduced water consumption can be achieved in all the regions in the monsoon season even with improved food production except in Punjab.

	abstract = {This review article examines the revolutionary possibilities of machine learning (ML) and intelligent algorithms for enabling renewable energy, with an emphasis on the energy domains of solar, wind, biofuel, and biomass. Critical problems such as data variability, system inefficiencies, and predictive maintenance are addressed by the integration of ML in renewable energy systems. Machine learning improves solar irradiance prediction accuracy and maximizes photovoltaic system performance in the solar energy sector. ML algorithms help to generate electricity more reliably by enhancing wind speed forecasts and wind turbine efficiency. ML improves the efficiency of biofuel production by optimizing feedstock selection, process parameters, and yield forecasts. Similarly, ML models in biomass energy provide effective thermal conversion procedures and real-time process management, guaranteeing increased energy production and operational stability. Even with the enormous advantages, problems such as data quality, interpretability of the models, computing requirements, and integration with current systems still remain. Resolving these issues calls for interdisciplinary cooperation, developments in computer technology, and encouraging legislative frameworks. This study emphasizes the vital role of ML in promoting sustainable and efficient renewable energy systems by giving a thorough review of present ML applications in renewable energy, highlighting continuing problems, and outlining future prospects. © 2024.

	abstract = {Global warming and climate change urge the deployment of close carbon-neutral technologies via the synthesis of low-carbon emission fuels and materials. An efficient intermediate product of such technologies is the biomethanol produced from biomass. Microalgae based technologies offer scalable solutions for the biofixation of CO2, where the produced biomass can be transformed into value-added fuel gas mixtures by applying thermochemical processes. In this study, the environmental and economic performances of biomethanol production are examined using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the modelling of catalytic and noncatalytic hydrothermal gasification (HTG). Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularisation algorithms are applied to describe the thermocatalytic transformation involving various types of feedstocks (biomass and wastes) in the training process. The relationship between the elemental composition of the feedstock, HTG reaction conditions (380 °C–717 °C, 22.5 MPa–34.4 MPa, 1–30 wt% biomass-to-water ratio, 0.3 min–60.0 min residence time, up to 5.5 wt% NaOH catalyst load) and fuel gas yield & composition are determined for Chlorella vulgaris strain. The ideal ANN topology is characterised by high training performance (MSE = 5.680E-01) and accuracies (R2 ≥ 0.965) using 2 hidden layers with 17-17 neurons. The process flowsheeting of biomass-to-methanol valorisation is performed using ASPEN Plus software involving the ANN-based HTG fuel gas profiles. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out to evaluate the climate change potential of biomethanol production alternatives. It is obtained that high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (−725 kg CO2,eq (t CH3OH)−1) can be achieved by enriching the HTG syngas composition with H2 using variable renewable electricity sources. The utilisation of hydrothermal gasification for the synthesis of biomethanol is found to be a favourable process alternative due to the (i) variable synthesis gas composition, (ii) heat integration, and (iii) GHG emission mitigation possibilities. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Industrial park wastewater treatment is an important step in reducing pollutants and improve the quality of water environment. Natural conditions, influent impact, diversity of pollutant composition and complexity of wastewater treatment technology lead to uncertainty and change of wastewater treatment system in industrial parks. These uncertainties lead to fluctuations in effluent quality and operating costs in industrial parks, as well as environmental risks in receiving water bodies. Artificial intelligence has become a powerful tool to reduce the complexity and risks of wastewater treatment. Through a large-scale bibliometric analysis of the application of artificial intelligence technology in wastewater treatment, this paper systematically reviews the application of artificial intelligence technology in five aspects of industrial park wastewater treatment, such as monitoring, pollutant removal, energy saving, management and wastewater reuse, and summarized the appropriate application scenarios, prediction accuracy and application limitations of typical artificial intelligence technology. Finally, we discuss potential future directions for utilizing the new research frontier of artificial intelligence in wastewater treatment plants, while addressing challenges of pollutant removal, cost reduction, water reuse and management in complex practical applications. © 2024 Chongqing University.

	abstract = {Global plastics production has doubled since the beginning of 21st century. Efficient technology is called for plastics waste valorization. The current review provides an overview of the main waste plastic chemical upcycling technologies to produce value-added products. Various technologies including gasification and pyrolysis are under reviewed. However, several review literatures have paid attention to the details and experimental progress in these chemical upcycling techniques. In this review, we attempt to conclude the progress in a multi-scale systems-by-systems perspective. After a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art chemical upcycling techniques, larger-scale process synthesis, assessment, and optimization methodologies to address the sustainability and environmental issues are summarized. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment are selected as two powerful tools for process assessment. Three particular application scenarios of optimization methodologies including experimental design, process synthesis and supply chain management are consequently introduced. Very little work on review articles have summarized the plastic waste-to-wealth process in the systems engineering perspective. Review results show that (1) gasification and pyrolysis offer promising avenues for the conversion of plastic waste into valuable products. These technologies can be integrated with other subsystems to enhance the economic and environmental performance of the overall system. (2) Response surface methodology is commonly used in experimental design and parameter optimization. It allows researchers to systematically investigate the effects of various parameters and optimize process conditions to maximize desired outputs. (3) Superstructure optimization frameworks are valuable tools for process synthesis and pathway selection in plastic waste conversion. However, the potential superstructure is pre-defined. (4) Green supply chain and multi-objective supply chain frameworks can be applied to the design of plastic waste recycling networks, taking into account both economic and environmental considerations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

This study proposed a new framework for managing waste by exploiting it as an endless resource for generating energy. The suggested framework establishes a comprehensive waste management plan in two stages. The first stage determines the optimum waste-to-energy (WtE) technology based on key criteria by employing TOPSIS. These criteria are not restricted to sustainable dimensions and consider technical dimensions as well. The second stage designs a supply chain structure based on the installation of a WtE power plant, with the goal of maximising profit while minimising CO2 emissions. The proposed adaptive model allows the decision-maker to choose a WtE technology in the first stage and accordingly outline the supply chain structure. A municipal solid waste management case study provided insights into how the proposed framework could help decision-makers create a better environment. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Over the past decades, classical optimization methods have been developed as useful tools to discover optimal solutions for multi-objective problems (MOPs). In recent years, under uncertainty, multi-objective Optimization (MOO) has received much attention due to its practical applications in real-world problems. However, many studies have been conducted on this matter. Some of which ignored the effects of uncertainty on optimization problems. This paper systematically reviews and summarizes various multi-objective methods applied to the problems with more than one objective in uncertain environments where uncertainty is expressed using fuzzy sets. In this paper, 439 articles on fuzzy multi-objective programming published from 1978 to 2021 are reviewed using corresponding texts, charts, and tables. Finally, the basic features of MOO are briefly presented, along with a prologue of MOO techniques and current trends. Recommendations for further research are also is provided. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Optimizing the economic and environmental impacts of the biomass supply chains can help realizing these benefits. In this study, a bi-objective robust optimization model is developed for tactical supply chain planning of forest biomass gasification at a pulp mill. It optimizes the monthly flow, inventory, and preprocessing of biomass while minimizing annual costs and emissions. Robust optimization with an adjustable risk of constraint violation is used to model the uncertainties in supply and cost of biomass. The average cost and emissions of the robust Pareto-optimal solutions are 68% and 41% higher than those in the deterministic solutions, respectively. Although, the cost and emissions and their trade-off in the deterministic case are more favorable, the robust solutions ensure no biomass shortage while avoiding over-conservatism. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transition to a circular economy through sustainable waste management (WM) follows different paths in each region, depending on its socioeconomic conditions and existing infrastructure. Mathematical optimization models are rigorous tools for informing local decision-making and identifying WM policy levers based on a variety of configurations. This review explores the pathways taken when designing WM optimization models (WM-OMs) that establish a network of waste valorization technologies. To standardize the literature review process, we propose a novel characterization method for examining, relating, and benchmarking the features of WM-OMs. After a thorough review of 58 articles published between 2015 and 2022, we assembled a comprehensive database to document the characteristics of these papers and the type of data reported in their case studies. We aim to provide a solid foundation for streamlining and enhancing future WM-OMs. Our work identifies various opportunities to improve the accuracy and reliability of WM-OMs. They include modeling thermo-chemical reactions in WM processes; considering regulatory, environmental, and political constraints; recognizing the informal sector; exploring the impact of marketing mechanisms on waste prevention and recycling; improving the traceability of case study data; specifying the rationale for uncertainty analysis (UA); and indicating the mathematical model (type, optimization algorithm, and equations). As many WM-OM authors have implemented UA without justifying their method choices, our review provides a pioneering guide for selecting the UA approach. Finally, we discuss the need for a trade-off between performance and practicality as models become more complex, making it critical to consider the specific needs of stakeholders. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Waste-to-energy technologies compatible with recycling are promising solutions for sustainable municipal waste management from both economic and environmental perspectives. This study focuses on the economic-environment-energy (3E) objective-driven integrated waste management optimization problems under deep complexities. A novel multi-objective programming model is developed to assist the optimal decision-making with the consideration of system profit, greenhouse gas emission, and energy recovery simultaneously. Besides, it advances existing optimization methods by incorporating interval-valued fuzzy numbers to tackle the ambiguity and the essential fuzziness in experts’ judgment. It was verified by a case study from an urban district of Beijing, China. The optimum waste treatment facility planning and waste stream allocation strategies with multi-objective tradeoffs were obtained to support decision-making considering different preferences of importance ranking. In general, incineration and anaerobic digestion would be the main technologies for waste disposal in the study area. Recycling would be greatly encouraged when pursuing more economic profits and greenhouse gas emission reduction. With withdrawing the subsidy in the future, the investment in anaerobic digestion would become less attractive. Meanwhile, the landfill with gas recovery would even become economically infeasible if there is no further reduction in cost. In addition, waste source separation is also a crucial factor for successful integrated waste management. It is suggested that a proper government subsidy and public participation in waste source separation would guarantee the sustainable development of the integrated waste management system. © 2022},

In the present study, waste food and animal refuse-derived biogas were tested as fuel in a diesel engine. To further enhance the waste-to-energy perspective waste cooking oil biodiesel − diesel blends were used as pilot fuel. A comprehensive set of operational settings including fuel injection timing, pressure, compression ratios, different flow rates of biogas, and engine loads were tested. Four machine learning approaches Linear Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) were employed to develop prognostic models. The developed models for engine performance and emission were predicted with high accuracy with R2 values as high as 0.9962 for brake-specific fuel consumption and 0.9948 for brake thermal efficiency. The prediction errors were low 0.06 for BTE during model training and 0.18 during the model testing phase while it was almost negligible in the case of BSFC. All models were compared using statistical metrics and violin plots. The DT-based forecasting models were observed to be the best among all the models both based on statistical measures as well as violin plots. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Municipal solid waste in a circular economy will be used as a resource, and the design of a product-oriented waste management network is essential. Considering the significant added value of bioenergy, it is one of the most important outputs of the waste management network that the production of a diverse range of them needs further study. Focusing on this issue, a sustainable waste management network was designed to optimally extract various bioenergies by considering all three dimensions of economic, environmental, and social sustainability under uncertain conditions. The proposed model in this research for the sustainable municipal solid waste network was a multi-objective possibilistic mixed-integer non-linear programming. For dealing with uncertainty in this network, a combination of methods based on interactive fuzzy programming was used. The model was implemented after collecting data from Arad Kooh, Iran as a case study using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software. The results of the proposed solution method were the amount of bioenergies generated by treatment technologies and the launched technologies throughout the defined time interval. The validation results of the proposed solution method confirm the research results.  © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {A holistic literature review of 399 articles is presented on hybrid solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems and taxonomized through a unique classification methodology that considers primary energy sources, component configurations, system outputs and relevant analysis. In the reviewed research articles, primarily four different types of technologies are used to complement the energy production of the fuel cell stack. As a result, four respective categories were established in terms of the coupling components, inclusive of (1) wind turbines (WTs), (2) solar systems (SS), (3) thermal power plant turbines (TPPTs) and (4) piston engines (PEs). Additional classification was needed to further subdivide the evaluated system configurations, due to the wide spectrum of system outputs encountered in the reviewed literature. That involved (a) electrical power generation (PG), (b) four types of cogeneration (CG), (c) four types of trigeneration (TG) and (d) two types of multigeneration (MG). Depending on the type of assessment in respective research, literature was further categorized as computational, experimental, or both computational and experimental. The most prevalent hybrid system amongst the 102 designs, as adapted from the reviewed literature, is the SOFC/gas turbine (GT) application, with the overwhelming majority producing exclusively electrical power output. The particular system is physically demonstrated in an existing 220-kW experimental facility established by the National Fuel Cell Research Center (NFCRC). The identified systems were predominantly computationally examined and research focused on operating conditions around specific design load ratings. Energy, exergy, economic, and environmental assessments were typically followed by sensitivity studies in the reviewed literature. The primary decision variables in most cases revolved around SOFC operating conditions, such as temperatures over 1000 °C as well as elevated pressures. Those resulted in the deterioration of the electrochemical cell and failed to be addressed by the majority of encountered studies. Improvements in the conversion efficiency of PG applications were enabled by natural gas (NG)-fed pressurized SOFCs, directly coupled to GTs. The most efficient power configuration in terms of thermodynamic performance was achieved by coupling PEs to SOFCs and a metal hydride reactor (MHR) to unlock a maximum net system efficiency of 79.54%. CG systems integrating solar cells (SCs) and photovoltaic panels (PVs) to SOFC subsystems can result in a combined efficiency of approximately 90% and sustain this over a broad energy demand range. TG systems incorporating gasifiers to SOFC/GT subsystems achieved a combined efficiency of 93%, whereas the optimal combined efficiency in MG configurations was identified at 79.5% by coupling SCs to the SOFC/GT/organic Rankine cycle turbine (ORCT) subsystems. In terms of cost-effectiveness, configurations that relied on increasing levels of renewable energy (RE) technologies resulted in high overall levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). This cost was increased further when power storage units were deployed to address wind and solar intermittency challenges. Configurations classified under TPPTs operating on low carbon-content fuels were preferred in terms of providing lower LCOE, while applications operating on gasified biomass and coal blends should deploy additional CO2 capture and storage units to mitigate respective emissions. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Biochar is emerging as a potential solution for biomass conversion to meet the ever increasing demand for sustainable energy. Efficient management systems are needed in order to exploit fully the potential of biochar. Modern machine learning (ML) techniques, and in particular ensemble approaches and explainable AI methods, are valuable for forecasting the properties and efficiency of biochar properly. Machine-learning-based forecasts, optimization, and feature selection are critical for improving biomass management techniques. In this research, we explore the influences of these techniques on the accurate forecasting of biochar yield and properties for a range of biomass sources. We emphasize the importance of the interpretability of a model, as this improves human comprehension and trust in ML predictions. Sensitivity analysis is shown to be an effective technique for finding crucial biomass characteristics that influence the synthesis of biochar. Precision prognostics have far-reaching ramifications, influencing industries such as biomass logistics, conversion technologies, and the successful use of biomass as renewable energy. These advances can make a substantial contribution to a greener future and can encourage the development of a circular biobased economy. This work emphasizes the importance of using sophisticated data-driven methodologies such as ML in biochar synthesis, to usher in ecologically friendly energy solutions. These breakthroughs hold the key to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. © 2024 Society of Industrial Chemistry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The thermal performance of a flat plate solar collector operating under thermosyphon conditions using MWCNT + Fe3O4/Water hybrid nanofluids was investigated in this study. Field testing was carried out at various nanoparticle concentrations at varying Reynold's numbers. At Reynold's number of 1413 and 0.3 vol%, the peak thermal efficiency of 63.84 % was attained. There was a large improvement in heat transfer coefficient (26.3 %) with a slight penalty through friction factor (18.9 %). When operated with hybrid nanofluids with 0.3 %, 0.2 %, 0.1 %, and 0.05 % vol. fractions and Re values of 1413, 1674, 1774, and 1892, the collector's exergy efficiency was increased by 40.51 %, 36.86 %, 33.21 %, and 29.56 %, respectively. Extensive testing yielded experimental data that was used to create new parametric correlation functions for heat transfer coefficient, friction factor, Nusselt's number, and collector thermal efficiency, and to create a novel prognostic model using the Ensemble Boosted Regression Tree Optimized using Bayesian Approach (BOBRT). The R, R2, MSE, and MAPD values for the BOBRT-based output models were 0.9803–0.9999, 0.961–0.9998, 0.00003–9.326, and 0.0025–0.0662, respectively.

	abstract = {Turquoise Hydrogen, a new generation of hydrogen production, is much closer to green and less polluting than regular Hydrogen. Substantial evidence indicates that Mexico's organic waste has significant potential with this technology. Although Turquoise Hydrogen has not yet been implemented in Mexico, preliminary studies are necessary to facilitate its future deployment. Therefore, this work studies the potential types and volumes of suitable organic waste for pyrolysis in Mexico. Subsequently, based on the available statistics in the state of Nuevo León and the waste disposal and recovery methods, a model is developed to select the locations for waste control and pyrolysis. The optimization model in this study is formulated as a bi-objective problem and then transformed into an integer linear programming model. Furthermore, an analysis of executable scenarios for organizing Hydrogen's closed-loop supply chain is performed. The results indicate that the developed model in this research can significantly enhance the closed-loop cycle in municipal and industrial solid wastes. It can not only facilitate the separation of waste in gray hydrogen production but also redirect a substantial portion of recyclable waste to recycling centers, further reducing waste disposal. This model can serve as a foundation for selecting optimal locations and minimizing decision-maker costs in establishing and developing blue and turquoise Hydrogen in Mexico. Additionally, the discussion underscores the importance of the government's role in optimizing waste separation and maximizing supply chain efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article presents the planning (sizing) of a renewable off-grid system that depends on hydrogen storage. The system manages both electric and hydrogen energy and considers the smart charging of electric vehicles. The system stated utilizes wind, solar, and bio-waste renewable resources to mitigate environmental pollution. Hydrogen storage serves the purpose of storing electrical energy and supplying hydrogen to users. The suggested approach attempts to possibly decrease the installation and maintenance cost of resources, electronic power converters, and hydrogen storage. It is associated with the planning-operation model of the specified elements, as well as the smart charging model of electric vehicles, which involves the simultaneous management of electric and hydrogen energies. Stochastic optimization is employed to represent the uncertainties associated with load, renewable resources, and electric vehicles. The Red Panda Optimization approach is employed to obtain a reliable optimal solution. The proposed plan includes the development of a renewable island system that utilizes electric and hydrogen energy management. It involves modeling a bio-waste unit and hydrogen storage within the system. Additionally, the plan adopts a smart charging model for electric vehicles in the island system. The plan also addresses uncertainties through modeling and employs a specific algorithm for problem-solving. These innovations are key components of the proposed plan. Ultimately, the strategy was executed using the data from Epsoo, Finland. The quantitative findings demonstrate the acceptable performance of the strategy in boosting the economic status of the island system. Smart charging of electric vehicles resulted in a 7.8 % decrease in planning cost compared to the traditional conventional charging method. Hydrogen storages, unlike battery (compressed air storage), have the added benefit of improving the economic conditions of the island system by approximately 7.9 % (2.1 %). Additionally, the presence of a bio-waste unit in the island system leads to a significant 17.8 % reduction in planning costs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes a multi-objective, sustainable viticultural supply chain network design model that simultaneously minimizes costs, mitigates environmental impacts and enhances social benefits. To address the complexity of vineyard selection, a pioneering hybrid strategy, integrating a data envelopment analysis method and an artificial neural network approach is developed, enabling the identification of optimal vineyard locations based on sustainability criteria. Furthermore, a robust optimization approach is devised to handle uncertainties in the supply chain. The augmented ε-constraint method is employed to solve the multi-objective model, balancing trade-offs among conflicting objectives. A real-world case study in Iran validates the model, demonstrating its efficacy in improving network efficiency, minimizing waste, and maintaining product quality. Sensitivity analysis highlights the robust model's superiority over the deterministic approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data and high uncertainty. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid strategy in fostering a sustainable and robust viticultural supply chain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The concentration on producing clean energy such as biofuels in recent years has had an impact on some of the natural resources that humans use, such as water, food, and land. In this paper, a two-phase approach to design and optimize a biofuel supply chain based on Jatropha Curcas L. oil and used cooking oil (UCO) is presented by considering the nexus between energy, water, food, waste, and land (EWFWL) in order to protect natural resources and create environmental security. In the first phase, the most appropriate sites for Jatropha cultivation are determined by considering the accessibility, geological, environmental and climatic criteria, using the Geographic Information System (GIS). In the second phase, a novel multi-objective model is designed considering the EWFWL nexus and solved using the Torabi-Hassini method. The model is validated using real data from Fars province, Iran, as well as a sensitivity analysis. In this study, some of main contributions are identifying suitable Jatropha cultivation sites in Fars province, Iran; development an innovative optimization model regarding EWFWL nexus; and considering financial parameters and global distribution along with EWFWL nexus. According to the results, the sale of biofuel to local and foreign consumers accounts for the largest proportion of network revenues, contributing for 59.25% of total revenue. Furthermore, increasing the use of UCOs for biofuel production will reduce Jatropha output, and consequently reduce water, land use, and increase food security. If UCO shortage occurs, more lands will be dedicated to Jatropha farms and food-loss and water consumption increase. By focusing on biofuel production over UCO, policymakers can produce less Jatropha and decrease the use of land for Jatropha cultivation. Furthermore, effluent-based irrigation can be more widely used to save fresh water by irrigating Jatropha farms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The article investigates the development of a biomass supply chain model by studying the logistic, network optimisation, transportation and economic impact as it affects the southwest Nigeria, with a particular emphasis on the conversion of crop residues into bioproducts such as bioethanol and biodigestate for electricity generation. This model compares the energy produced from single and multiple feedstocks using simulation methods implemented in the MATLAB 2022b programming language solver with the linprog function to implement linear programming to investigate the maximum revenue and minimum production costs as they affect biomass supply chain in southwest Nigeria. The sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the impact of key parameters by measuring essential uncertainty features to show the profitability of the supply chain network while employing feedstock such as cassava peel, maize husk, rice straw, and sorghum bran. The study's findings provide insight into the optimal design and operation of the biomass supply chain in Southwest Nigeria, as well as the viability and potential of using various feedstocks for energy generation while taking into account the economic and logistical aspects of the supply chain. The optimisation framework provides decision-makers and stakeholders with practical tools to improve the sustainability of biomass utilisation and efficiency in the region, and research will help to develop a more robust and environmentally friendly energy system in the region, easing the transition to a renewable and sustainable future. © 2023},

	abstract = {Circular economy has the potential to counter sustainability challenges by moving towards a circular flow that enhances the efficiency of resource use. Government directives and stakeholders’ pressures are forcing organisations to redesign their global supply chain network to fit sustainability and circularity aims. To fulfil this need, many models are proposed to integrate sustainability objectives in supply chain optimisation. However, designing a sustainable supply chain within the circular economy framework is lacking. This is a barrier for organisations to provide a circular and sustainable product. To fill this gap, descriptive and content analysis are used in this paper to scrutinise literature and develop a conceptual framework incorporating sustainability objectives and circular economy strategies to assist supply network design. The developed framework is a useful tool that helps in a better transition from a linear to a sustainable circular economy. Based on the results, research opportunities are identified and suggestions for future research are proposed.

Biogas from agricultural and municipal organic waste is gaining momentum as a renewable energy source. Concurrently, the European Hydrogen Strategy focuses on green hydrogen for decarbonising the industrial and transportation sectors. This paper presents a multi-objective network design model for urban–industrial symbiosis, incorporating anaerobic digestion, cogeneration, photovoltaic, and hydrogen production technologies. Additionally, a Bayesian best-worst method is used to evaluate the weights of the sustainability aspects by decision-makers, integrating these into the mathematical model. The model optimises industrial plant locations considering economic, environmental, and social parameters, including the net present value, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. The model’s functionalities are demonstrated through a real-world case study based in Emilia Romagna, Italy. It is subject to sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the inputs affect the outcomes and highlights feasible trade-offs through the exploration of the (Formula presented.) -constraint. The findings demonstrate that the model substantially boosts energy and hydrogen production. It is not only economically viable but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with fossil fuels and landfilling. Additionally, it contributes to job creation. This research has significant implications, with potential future studies intended to focus on system resilience, plant location optimisation, and sustainability assessment. © 2024 by the authors.},

In the face of pressing environmental challenges, transitioning to sustainable, efficient, and eco-friendly energy sources is imperative. This study aims to assess the potential of industrial waste for bioenergy production in Khorasan Province, Iran, addressing the research gap of developing a comprehensive framework of criteria that was lacking in previous studies. Employing a combined technology and material assessment methodology, the research began with the collection and analysis of questionnaires to identify and weight critical criteria using Shannon Entropy and expert insights. The Additive Ratio Assessment method was then used to rank various types of industrial waste and technologies according to established value criteria. The Findings reveal that anaerobic digestion of organic waste emerges as the most viable bioenergy solution with an 85 % desirability score, followed by anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and gasification of plastic waste, scoring 77.31 % and 69.41 %, respectively. The innovative aspect of this study is the development and implementation of five novel evaluation criteria, including process temperature, technology lifetime, production cost, waste collection cost, and waste separation cost, which have not been previously applied to the assessment of industrial waste for renewable energy production, especially in developing countries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biowaste remediation and valorization for environmental sustainability focuses on prevention rather than cleanup of waste generation by applying the fundamental recovery concept through biowaste-to-bioenergy conversion systems - an appropriate approach in a circular bioeconomy. Biomass waste (biowaste) is discarded organic materials made of biomass (e.g., agriculture waste and algal residue). Biowaste is widely studied as one of the potential feedstocks in the biowaste valorization process due to its being abundantly available. In terms of practical implementations, feedstock variability from biowaste, conversion costs and supply chain stability prevent the widespread usage of bioenergy products. Biowaste remediation and valorization have used artificial intelligence (AI), a newly developed idea, to overcome these difficulties. This report analyzed 118 works that applied various AI algorithms to biowaste remediation and valorization-related research published between 2007 and 2022. Four common AI types are utilized in biowaste remediation and valorization: neural networks, Bayesian networks, decision tree, and multivariate regression. The neural network is the most frequent AI for prediction models, the Bayesian network is utilized for probabilistic graphical models, and the decision tree is trusted for providing tools to assist decision-making. Meanwhile, multivariate regression is employed to identify the relationship between experimental variables. AI is a remarkably effective tool in predicting data, which is reportedly better than the conventional approach owing to its characteristics of time-saving and high accuracy. The challenge and future work in biowaste remediation and valorization are briefly discussed to maximize the model's performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Biomass, as one of the most accessible renewable resources, could reduce dependency on fossil fuels and mitigate associated environmental impacts. With economic development and improved living standards, biomass in rural areas is converted into various forms of energy to meet high energy demands. However, existing studies on rural multi-energy system operations assume energy production from biomass is a given input parameter and consider it to be a fixed constant or subject to upper and lower bounds, independent of the biomass supply chain. Indeed, biomass energy production is significantly influenced by the collection, transportation, storage, and other processes within the supply chain. This work proposes a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for the joint optimization of an integrated rural multi-biomass-solid waste energy conversion system with a source-grid-demand-based biomass-solid waste supply chain (IRMBS-BSC system). The IRMBS-BSC system encompasses three sub-systems: the biomass-solid waste source sub-system, the biomass-solid waste grid sub-system, and the biomass-solid waste demand sub-system. Various biomass-solid wastes are classified, and a source model is established to evaluate their availability. Subsequently, a supply chain model is developed within the biomass-solid waste grid sub-system. Based on the available and transported quantity from the biomass-solid waste source sub-system and grid sub-system, a multi-energy system operation model, considering refined biomass conversion processes, is proposed. A case study involving a multi-energy system that integrates multiple rural community biomass-solid waste supplies is conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed MILP, which considers the biomass-solid waste supply chain, can reduce energy imports during the load peak periods and can also decrease the overall operational costs of the multi-energy system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {One of the main limitations to the economic sustainability of biodiesel production remains the high feedstock cost. Modeling and optimization are crucial steps to determine if processes (esterification and transesterification) involved in biodiesel production are economically viable. Phenomenological or mechanistic models can simulate the processes. These methods have been used to simulate and manage the processes, but their broad use has been constrained by computational complexity and numerical difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to use quick, effective, accurate, and resilient modeling methodologies to simulate and regulate such complex systems. Data-driven computational and machine-learning (ML) techniques offer a potential replacement for conventional modeling methodologies to deal with the nonlinear, unpredictable, complex, and multivariate nature of biodiesel systems. Artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) are the most often utilized ML tools in biodiesel research. To effectively attain maximum biodiesel yield, suitable optimization techniques based on nature-inspired optimization algorithms need to be integrated with these tools to obtain the best possible combination of various operating variables. Future research should focus on utilizing ML approaches for monitoring and managing biodiesel production systems to increase their effectiveness and promote commercial feasibility. Thus, the review discusses the various ML techniques used in modeling and optimizing biodiesel production systems. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Many companies and organizations are pursuing “carbon footprint” projects to estimate their own contribution due to growing concerns about global climate change and carbon emissions. Measures such as carbon taxes are the most powerful means of dealing with the threats of climate change. In recent years, researchers have shown a particular interest in modelling supply chain networks under this scheme. Disorganized disposal of by-products from sugarcane mills is the inspiration of this research. In order to connect the problem with the real world, the proposed sustainable sugarcane supply chain network considers carbon taxes on the emission from industries and during transportation of goods. The presented mixed-integer linear programming modelling is a location-allocation problem and, due to the inherent complexity, it is considered a Non-Polynomial hard (NP-hard) problem. To deal with the model, three superior metaheuristics Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Social Engineering Optimizer (SEO) and hybrid methods based on these metaheuristics, namely, Genetic-Simulated Annealing (GASA) and Genetic-Social Engineering Optimizer (GASEO), are employed. The control parameters of the algorithms are tuned using the Taguchi approach.

	abstract = {One of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals is to “Ensure access to affordable, sustainable, and clean energy for all.” Additionally, the growing concerns about climate change and energy security have heightened the importance of exploring alternative energy sources to replace fossil fuels. The utilisation of agricultural waste for bioenergy production has acquired significant attention due to its potential to mitigate environmental impacts and provide renewable energy sources. However, the major obstacle to producing bioenergy is managing the supply chain while considering economic, environmental, and social factors in an optimal way. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the management of agriculture waste supply chains, specifically related to the use of modelling and optimisation techniques for planning. The first section describes different stages of the supply chain and various technologies for converting biomass to bioenergy. This is followed by a synopsis of the literature reviewed based on decision levels, objective functions, modelling methodologies, and optimisation approaches.

	abstract = {Global warming, adverse environmental consequences, and the rapid depletion of oil resources are some of the critical challenges that humanity presently confronts due to the utilization of fossil fuels. Replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources of energy such as biofuel is crucial for a clean environment. In addition to its numerous advantages, the production of biofuels has detrimental effects on natural resources as well. Water, energy, and land are all required to produce food and energy, which are inextricably linked as the essential inputs for agriculture and fuel production. Undesirable climate change and its impacts on ecosystems are also consequences of this process. This study offers a two-phase approach to designing a canola-to-biodiesel supply chain. The first phase is concerned with finding appropriate sites for canola cultivation in accordance with climatic, social, economic and design criteria. To achieve an ideal solution, the fuzzy best-worst method and the fuzzy technique of order preference similarity to the ideal solution are simultaneously used. In the second phase, a new multi-objective integer programming model that involves a water-energy-food-land-ecosystem-undesirable climate change nexus is introduced. The suggested model enhances crop harvest from desirable agricultural areas, maximizes the profit, preserves ecosystem values, mitigates undesirable climate changes, and reduces water and energy consumption. An interactive fuzzy method is used to solve the model, and the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated through a real case study for Iran. Sensitivity analyses are also performed on the key parameters. According to the findings, production activities are connected with the increase of network costs, adverse changes in climate, and increased use of energy. Thus, using high-yield catalysts, increasing the production scale, complying with environmental regulations, receiving government subsidies, investing in research to improve production technologies, and identifying cost-saving strategies can minimize harmful environmental effects and reduce biodiesel production costs, thereby boosting the profit. Furthermore, given Iran's water scarcity and reduced rainfall, increasing the canola yield per hectare might lead to less land use and water consumption for irrigation. Utilizing specialized machinery, enhancing farmers’ skills in canola cultivation, supplying seeds on time, planting promptly, providing optimal nutrition, and promoting pest management are all effective methods to boost canola yields. The insights provided in this study can help managers in the canola-based biodiesel production sector make better decisions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the significance of optimizing green supply chain management (GSCM) has gained unprecedented attention from both scholars and industry professionals. This surge in interest has led researchers to employ diverse modeling approaches in the pursuit of enhancing green supply chain networks. In this systematic review, we analyze 159 recent GSCM optimization papers published from 2017 to 2022 and identify the recent trends in mathematical modeling, multi-objective optimization, and the modeling/solver tools utilized. We find that the primary green focus is on minimizing carbon emissions (n = 44), reflecting the increasing concern for environmental sustainability. Among the modeling approaches employed, mixed-integer linear programming has emerged as the most popular choice (n = 51), followed by game theory-based modeling (n = 30). When it comes to multiobjective optimization, the ε-constraint approach is the most widely used. Evolutionary algorithms have emerged as the dominant meta-heuristic optimization approach. Additionally, the widely utilized solver in this domain is CPLEX with the most popular modeling/solver combination being GAMS/CPLEX. Moreover, the Journal of Cleaner Production was the leading outlet for research in this domain (n = 35). In addition to these findings, this study also discusses some other research trends and future research directions. Finally, we discuss the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications of this study. By providing GSCM researchers and practitioners with the latest trends in GSCM optimization approaches, this study contributes to the further advancement of the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Meeting the needs of a growing population calls for a change from linear production systems that exacerbate the depletion of finite natural resources and the emission of environmental pollutants. These linear production systems have resulted in the human-driven perturbation of the Earth's natural biogeochemical cycles and the transgression of environmentally safe operating limits. One solution that can help alleviate the environmental issues associated both with resource stress and harmful emissions is resource recovery from waste. In this review, we address the recovery of resources from food and beverage processing wastewater (FPWW), which offers a synergistic solution to some of the environmental issues with traditional food production. Research on resource recovery from FPWW typically focuses on technologies to recover specific resources without considering integrative process systems to recover multiple resources while simultaneously satisfying regulations on final effluent quality. Process Systems Engineering (PSE) offers methodologies able to address this holistic process design problem, including modelling the trade-offs between competing objectives. Optimisation of FPWW treatment and resource recovery has significant scope to reduce the environmental impacts of food production systems. There is significant potential to recover carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus resources while respecting effluent quality limits, even when the significant uncertainties inherent to wastewater systems are considered. This review article gives an overview of the environmental challenges we face, discussed within the framework of the planetary boundary, and highlights the impacts caused by the agri-food sector. This paper also presents a comprehensive review of the characteristics of FPWW and available technologies to recover carbon and nutrient resources from wastewater streams with a particular focus on bioprocesses. PSE research and modelling advances are discussed in this review. Based on this discussion, we conclude the article with future research directions. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The escalating global warming crisis and the dwindling traditional energy sources have spurred an urgent need for exploring sustainable and renewable energy options. In this context, third-generation biodiesel has emerged as a promising and cleaner alternative for the transportation sector, gaining widespread attention due to its environmental and social benefits. However, ensuring the sustainable and efficient production and delivery of biodiesel to the market requires an optimal supply chain management strategy, encompassing a coordinated effort by all stakeholders involved. This paper presents a novel multi-objective decision support model for managing a multi-echelon third-generation biodiesel supply chain comprising a biomass producer, a biorefinery, and multiple retailers. The proposed model leverages a multi-objective non-linear optimization framework, incorporating economic and environmental objectives to achieve a balance between profitability and sustainability. The economic performance of the model is analyzed using an uncertain activity-based costing approach and a single-setup-multi-delivery policy, while carbon emissions are reduced at every stage of the supply chain to enhance environmental performance. To deal with the uncertainties in the decision-making parameters, a robust possibilistic programming-based solution methodology is employed, providing optimality and feasibility robustness to the obtained solutions. Furthermore, a weighted goal programming approach is adopted to achieve an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives of the model, and the NP-hard problem is solved using a metaheuristic approach. The practical applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated through an experimental study, and the performance of the numerical outcomes is analyzed under varying decision-maker preferences and sensitivity analysis. The experimental findings indicate that SSMD reduces the total cost of the system. The proposed approach can be used to evaluate the environmental, economic, and technological factors that can enhance supply chain management performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Towards this, a multi-objective optimisation model is proposed in this study to create an integrated sustainable and resilient FSC. The proposed model employs four objective functions - each representing a dimension of sustainability and one for resilience and utilises an augmented e-constraint method for solving. The findings highlight the interplay between sustainability aspects and resilience, illustrating that overemphasis on any single dimension can adversely affect others. Further, the proposed model is applied to the case of Indian mango pulp supply chain and several inferences are derived.

	abstract = {Climate change, global warming, and the negative consequences of fossil fuels on human life and the environment have prompted governments to seek a long-term replacement for fossil fuels, such as biofuel. According to a few considerations of sustainable supplier selection in the area of constructing biofuel supply chains, import and export activities, financial decisions, and all aspects of sustainability at the same time, this research creates a novel multi-objective model for designing a biofuel supply chain by incorporating financial decisions, sustainability, international suppliers and markets. Supplier selection criteria are weighted using the fuzzy best-worst method, and suppliers are ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS. A possibilistic programming approach based on the Me fuzzy measure is utilized to deal with parameter uncertainties. A fuzzy programming approach is implemented to solve the model. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested model, an actual case study in Iran is used. The numerical results show that biofuel production and transportation operations account for the bulk of overall costs. Greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of water required contribute significantly to the environmental goal. When compared to deterministic models, profit and social objectives are lower in uncertain models, while order allocation and environmental objectives are higher, but the system will hedge against the high level of uncertainty. In conclusion, the suggested model has a notable impact on improving sustainable facets and can be implemented by governments and legislators. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to provide an improvement in the modeling of supply chain designs by incorporating correlated uncertainty among multiple parameters, resulting in a more resilient design. A new methodology to generate forecasts for historically correlated time series, regardless of their underlying probability distributions, is presented and applied to generate scenarios for energy and carbon prices, which historically proved to be correlated. These scenarios are then used in a stochastic computation to obtain a three-echelon supply chain design in Europe maximizing the economic performance. The emissions were monetarized through the incorporation of the European Union cap-and-trade emissions trading system into the model. The social impact of the supply chain network is measured in terms of the direct, indirect and induced jobs it creates, which are proportional to the economic performance. By combining the developed methodology with data mining algorithms, a reduction in the number of required scenarios by more than 90% was achieved. The numerical case study moreover shows that the stochastic design ensures an average reduction of emissions by more than 3 ktons compared to the use of a deterministic approach. In comparison, the computation of a stochastic supply chain design without parameter correlation takes 5 times longer. © 2023 The Author(s)},

On the other hand, data-driven machine learning techniques would be very useful in nanofluid research for forecasting thermophysical features and heat transfer rate, identifying the most influential factors, and assessing the efficiencies of different renewable energy systems. The primary aim of this review study is to look at the features and applications of different machine learning techniques employed in the nanofluid-based renewable energy system, as well as to reveal new developments in machine learning research. A variety of modern machine learning algorithms for nanofluid-based heat transfer studies in renewable and sustainable energy systems are examined, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Artificial neural networks-based model prediction using contemporary commercial software is simple to develop and the most popular. The prognostic capacity may be further improved by combining a marine predator algorithm, genetic algorithm, swarm intelligence optimization, and other intelligent optimization approaches. In addition to the well-known neural networks and fuzzy- and gene-based machine learning techniques, newer ensemble machine learning techniques such as Boosted regression techniques, K-means, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), CatBoost, and XGBoost are gaining popularity due to their improved architectures and adaptabilities to diverse data types. The regularly used neural networks and fuzzy-based algorithms are mostly black-box methods, with the user having little or no understanding of how they function. This is the reason for concern, and ethical artificial intelligence is required. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Techno-economic analysis (TEA) has been considered an important tool to evaluate the economic performance of industrial processes. Recently, the application of TEA has been observed to have exponential growth due to the increasing competition among businesses across various industries. Thus, this review presents a deliberate overview of TEA to inculcate the importance and relevance of TEA. To further support the aforementioned points, this review article starts with a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the applicability of TEA within the research community. Conventional TEA is widely known to be conducted via software modeling (i.e., Python, AMIS, MATLAB, Aspen HYSYS, Aspen Plus, HOMER Pro, FORTRAN, R, SysML and Microsoft Excel) without involving any correlation or optimization between the process and economic performance. Apart from that, due to the arrival of the industrial revolution (IR) 4.0, industrial processes are being revolutionized into smart industries. Thus, to retain the integrity of TEA, a similar evolution to smart industries is deemed necessary. Studies have begun to incorporate data-driven technologies (i.e., artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain) into TEA to effectively optimize both processes and economic parameters simultaneously. With this, this review explores the integration of data-driven technologies in the TEA framework. From literature reviews, it was found that genetic algorithm (GA) is the most applied data-driven technology in TEA, while the applications of blockchain, machine learning (ML), and artificial neural network (ANN) in TEA are still considerably scarce. Not to mention other advanced technologies, such as cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics, digital twin (DT), and metaverse are yet to be incorporated into the existing TEA. The inclusion of set-up costs for the aforementioned technologies is also crucial for accurate TEA representation of smart industries deployment. Overall, this review serves as a reference note for future process engineers and industry stakeholders who wish to perform relevant TEA, which is capable to cover the new state-of-art elements under the new modern era.

	abstract = {Given the urgency to transition to low carbon future, oil refineries need to identify feasible strategies for decarbonisation. One way to address this is by integrating renewable energy systems. However, the high initial costs and intermittency appeared to be the key barriers for the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Hence, a multi-period optimisation model is developed via mixed integer linear programming in this work to determine the optimal renewable energy system in terms of cost and its optimal energy storage technology to enhance its flexibility for oil refinery operations. This model aims to minimise the costs of the renewable energy system while considering its ability to accommodate the varying energy demands across the time periods. An oil refinery case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model. The developed model is expected to propose an optimal renewable energy system that meets the energy demands and, at the same time, achieves the decarbonisation goal. Based on the results, the optimal renewable energy system comprises cost-effective technologies to generate various energy outputs including electricity, hydrogen, high-pressure and medium-pressure steam to meet energy demands. Additionally, the result of the case study shows that the integration of renewable energy systems achieves a reduction of 5,353 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Apart from that, the incorporation of energy-efficient energy storage results in a 10% reduction in the total cost of the optimal renewable energy system. Compressed hydrogen gas storage and battery were used to store excess hydrogen and electricity during periods with low demands and subsequently consumed during peak demand periods. This can, therefore, reduce the technological capacity required. With the aid of storage facilities, the flexibility of the renewable energy system is elevated in meeting varied demands, which otherwise would incur additional expenses. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {In the presence of increasing rates of disruptions, resilient and sustainable power networks are crucial for the performance of supply chains. Integrating renewable power grid with existing infrastructure can yield substantial benefits. Furthermore, the integrated design of the power network and supply chain is beneficial due to their mutual impact. This research focuses on designing an integrated power grid that incorporates renewable energy sources while fortifying traditional power infrastructure. The study investigates the impact on economic and environmental objectives, effectiveness in managing disruptions, and optimal timing for establishing renewable power networks on network design decisions. To this end, a bi-objective robust model is developed to design a green-resilient supply chain, considering power system disruptions, uncertainty in renewable energy supply and risk mitigation strategies. Given the inherent computational complexity of the problem, a heuristics method is presented. The proposed model and solution method are conducted in an Iranian dairy company and power network. Results revealed that across different perturbation levels of renewable energies, the integrated networks with renewable energies and fortification were found to be the most effective while non-resilient networks incurred the highest cost. The integration of renewable energy alone reduced costs by 13 %, and combining it with other strategies resulted in a 22 % cost benefit. While, fortification alone did not significantly reduce emissions, but the resilient network with fortification and renewable energies reduced emissions and unmet demand by 28.5 % and 33.4 %, respectively. Prioritizing renewable energy development is crucial during disruptions, and early integration improves network resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In response to the ever-increasing pursuit of competitiveness among organizations in today’s global business landscape, the subject of supply chain management has become a vital domain encompassing a wide range of sectors and industries across the economy. The growing concern about sustainable development has prompted public and private supply chain players to incorporate the three pillars of sustainability, namely, economic, environmental, and social, into the design of their supply chain networks. This study reviews and examines the content of 102 relevant papers to discuss the mathematical models, modeling approaches, and solutions that have been explored in the existing literature on forward sustainable supply chain network design. This paper also investigates the sustainability elements and supply chain network peculiarities including design factors and decision levels. In this review, several limitations in the current literature on sustainable supply chain network design optimization models are highlighted. According to the analysis, it was found that a better understanding of the industry and its sustainability requirements and priorities is essential for designing sustainable supply chain networks that are tailored to the needs of a specific industry rather than achieving general sustainability objectives. In addition, integrating strategic, tactical, and operational decision levels in the design of supply chain networks is critical for evaluating their impact on each other in terms of sustainability. More sophisticated mathematical solution methods for dealing with real-life scenarios including nonlinearity and uncertainty sources are required. The paper concludes with new prospects of research to promote a better integration of sustainability into supply chain networks. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Microalgal biomass is poised to become an important feedstock in the quest to decarbonize the fuels and chemical industries. In this way, it is imperative that researchers prioritize efforts for increased chances of economic viability of the microalgae biomass supply chain. This work applies a sequential techno-economic assessment (TEA) methodology to compare the economic trade-offs between microalgae growth and compositional shift while solving for an alternative economic metric: intrinsic algal biomass value, i.e., the revenue obtained from processing and converting the main components of algae biomass - carbohydrates, lipids, and protein - to a portfolio of products. The framework relies on data derived from small-scale cultivations to initially determine the maximum economic potential of different product portfolios as obtained in multiple biorefining setups. The approach further downselects the number of possible strains to undergo an in-depth TEA in order to quantify the value of transitioning from nutrient-replete to nutrient-deplete cultivations. Among the 13 permutations of strains and cultivation strategies analyzed, this study demonstrated an increase in intrinsic biomass value for four strains after the compositional shift: Chlorella sorokiniana DOE1412, Chlorella sorokiniana DOE1116, Scenedesmus obliquus UTEX393, and Scenedesmus obliquus DOE0152.Z. While product selection is critical in the exploitation of microalgal biomass, the four mentioned strains at least double their intrinsic biomass values, reaching up to $264/ton in net margins above minimum biomass selling prices. This is attainable without considering the production of small market size specialty chemicals, instead targeting markets with scalability potential and/or with currently large sizes. Two other strains, namely Picochlorum celeri WT-CSM/EMRE and Tetraselmis striata LANL1001, should have their biomass productivities increased by around 5 g/m2/day in nutrient-deplete cultivations to achieve economic viability. The concept of implementing an objective comparison between different portfolio configurations detailed herein is an innovative approach towards the economic assessment of microalgae valorization strategies. © 2023},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with population growth, rising global energy demand, increasing water consumption, carbon emissions, and excessive use of fossil fuels, the world faces a major challenge. Biomass is one of the most attractive sources of energy production, with positive effects on the economy, environment, and society, which can decrease the world's reliance on fossil fuels and deal with this universal challenge. Consequently, the biomass supply chain network design has received more attention in recent decades. Since energy and water are two significant sources for society's sustainable development and carbon emissions are essential for environmental health, the study of the water–energy–carbon (WEC) nexus is essential. In this study, a multiobjective multiperiod model for designing a sustainable supply chain network based on hybrid second-generation (i.e., Jatropha, agricultural waste, and animal waste) and third-generation (i.e., microalgae) biomasses is presented. The proposed multiobjective model consists of five objective functions that maximize the total energy produced and the number of jobs created and minimize the total water consumed, carbon emitted, and total costs. Case study results demonstrate the performance of the model utilizing the MINMAX goal programming approach. Based on the results, energy production from Jatropha is more appropriate in comparison with energy production from microalgae, agriculture waste, and animal waste. The findings also show that the proposed model in this research considering the WEC nexus performs significantly better than the classical model without considering the WEC nexus. © 2022 The Authors.

Understanding the current state of research in this field can highlight covered topics, identify trends, and reveal understudied topics warranting future research. However, few studies have systematically reviewed this intersection. In this study, we analyze 1068 publications within the IE–AI domain using trend factor analysis, word2vec modeling, and top2vec modeling. These methods uncover patterns of topic interconnections and evolutionary trends. Our results identify 71 trending terms within the selected publications, 69 of which, such as “deep learning,” have emerged in the past 8 years. The word2vec analysis shows that the application of various AI techniques is increasingly integrated into life cycle assessment and the circular economy. The top2vec analysis suggests that employing AI to predict and optimize indicators related to products, waste, processes, and their environmental impacts is an emerging trend.

	abstract = {The design of an efficient Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management network can reduce the network costs, such as investment, operational and recycling costs, and improve its sustainability, from economic to environmental and social perspectives. In this paper, a multi-objective scenario-based robust stochastic optimization model for designing a sustainable MSW management network under uncertainty is proposed. The proposed model has four objectives to seek sustainability from two quantitative and qualitative aspects. Considering the dynamicity of the factors affecting an MSW management network as well as the multiplicity of sustainability perspectives, the proposed model allows, on one hand, reaching a robust solution considering the potential scenarios, and on the other hand, integrating sustainability indicators while creating a balance between the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of such indicators. Moreover, the waste treatment technologies, as the highest added-value echelon of the MSW management network, which also distinguishes the network from a generic waste recycling network, has been investigated in the model. Finally, fuel consumption, have been particularly emphasized as critical factor, highly contributing to transportation costs and Co2 emission that are decisive criteria from both economic and environmental points of view. The proposed model and solution approach are validated through a real case study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and their detrimental impact on the environment necessitates the exploration of renewable energy alternatives. Biomass stands out as a reliable renewable source, especially in multigeneration systems. This study suggests a biomass-driven multigeneration configuration for the production of electricity, heating, hydrogen, and freshwater. The configuration is evaluated from thermodynamic and economic perspectives, utilizing an Artificial Neural Network to predict key outcomes. The system optimization process integrates Machine Learning with decision-making methods to achieve optimal conditions. The findings highlight that an anode-cathode gas recycling design is the most effective configuration for the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell unit, achieving a cycle efficiency of 67.68% and a product cost of $11.41/GJ. Municipal Solid Waste biomass and CO2 were identified as the most efficient fuel and gasification agents, respectively. The evaluations also determined that the integration of the multi-objective grey wolf optimizer and the CatBoost method is the most reliable machine learning model for optimization. Furthermore, by combining the Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm with TOPSIS, LINMAP, and Fuzzy decision-making approaches, the system achieves optimal performance across multiple scenarios. In one scenario, the system reached an exergy efficiency of 67.68% and a hydrogen production rate of 22.34 kg/h. The optimum recycling ratios for the anode and cathode were determined to be 0.16 and 0.38, respectively. The study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed configuration, offering significant potential for sustainable and cost-effective energy generation. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Bibliometric and scientific knowledge mapping was applied in this study to systematically review 4239 published papers (1991–2022) in the Web of Science (WOS) core database to obtain an overview of the current knowledge network and the status of waste management research, as well as summarizing the hotspots and frontiers for future research. The results show that: (1) Since the 21st century, SWM research has received extensive attention. During the study period, the number of publications increasing from 7 to 552 per year over the course of the century. An important turning point was reached in 2015, which was followed by a rapid increase in the number of articles published, reaching a peak in 2021. (2) Well known universities in China and around the world were the main sites of knowledge generation, and the cooperative research networks between these institutions resulted in numerous publications. However, international cooperation in this field was still insufficient. (3) Solid waste management research is an interdisciplinary and diversified field, among which integrated waste management and environmental economic assessment, impact mechanisms and residents' behavior, and environmental change and sustainable development were the main research topics. (4) Solid waste management research could be organized into 30 clusters, which were further classified into initial, development, and leapfrog stages based on a timeline analysis of the literature co-citation network. Combining the keyword burst detection results and research hotspots, research frontiers were summarized for four periods, which could be used to describe the phase upgrade of SWM research. Finally, future research directions were proposed in terms of their perspectives, content, methods, and context, including SWM based on the “order-emotion” framework; consideration of multi-stakeholder games; adoption of new paradigms (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence); and consideration of social and environmental changes and externality costs to build a healthier and more sustainable integrated management system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Harnessing renewable resources such as solar energy and biogenic waste for hydrogen production offers a path toward a carbon-neutral industrial economy. This study suggests the development of a renewable-based hydrogen and power supply facility (HPSF) that relies on fermentation and solar-driven electrolysis technologies to achieve penetration of renewable hydrogen and electricity in the industrial symbiosis. Literature studies reported that the hybrid battery-hydrogen storage system could effectively improve the sustainability and reliability of renewable energy supplies, yet its application under diurnal and seasonal renewable resource variations has not been well studied. Hence, this work develops a multi-criteria optimisation framework for the configuration design of the proposed HPSF that concurrently targets industrial hydrogen and electrical loads with the consideration of diurnal and seasonal renewable resource variations. Case scenarios with different storage applications are presented to evaluate the role of storage in improving economic and environmental sustainability. The results show that the application of hybrid storage with molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) systems is preferred from a comprehensive sustainability standpoint, which improves the sustainability-weighted return-on-investment metric (SWROIM) score by 4%/yr compared to HPSF without storage application. On the other hand, the application of a single-battery system is the most economical solution with a return on investment (ROI) of 0.7%/yr higher than the hybrid storage approach. The research outcome could provide insights into the integration of fermentative and solar-driven electrolytic hydrogen production technologies into the industrial symbiosis to further enhance a sustainable economy. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {To tackle the globally increasing discrepancy between food, energy and water demands and resource availability sustainably, resource supply system models have to incorporate the inter-dependencies and -connectivities to other supply systems. This leads naturally to a food–energy–water nexus (FEWN) approach. The FEWN can be interpreted as the study of the connections between the food, energy and water resource systems, emphasizing how decision-making influences the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs among the various sectors. In recent years, modeling and optimization of FEWN systems has been receiving an increasing interest in the open literature, however, with limited emphasis on how decisions of the FEWN are derived. In this review, FEWN optimization studies are analyzed with focus on the employed objectives, optimization and solution strategies, as well as the selected sub-systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales to uncover in detail how decision-making is facilitated. More specifically, FEWN optimization studies are classified according to their modeling and solution strategies. Based on this classification it is uncovered that (i) the decision-making itself has not yet been investigated in detail in FEWN literature, (ii) the incorporation of all aspects of the FEWN is still a challenge, (iii) the interconnection between FEWN systems and society has to be further investigated, and (iv) the implications of uncertainty for the resiliency, robustness and security of process systems is not yet well defined. Additionally, a generic FEWN resource-task network formulation is introduced to illustrate the similarities across the various resource supply sectors. Special interest is placed on how synergies are identified and competition be avoided among resource systems. It is shown that the selected spatial scale as well as the utilized modeling and optimization strategies significantly influence the synergy level of obtained solutions. Furthermore, it is derived that the energy transition has to incorporate FEWN systems thinking for sustainable solution generation. Overall, this review summarizes the different applications and implications of process systems engineering concepts to FEWN systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The aviation sector has been one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; there is an urgent need to transition from traditional fossil-based jet fuel to sustainable aviation fuel to meet net-zero targets by 2030. The use of renewable aviation fuel may be regarded as the most effective option for reducing GHG emissions in the aviation sector while allowing for long-term growth. In this study, the microalgae oil was transformed to develop hydrocarbons with the boiling point range of jet fuel. Following the transesterification of algal oil fatty acids to algal oil methyl ester, fractional distillation was carried out. The Box-Behnken technique was used to design experiments for efficient resource utilization by minimizing the number of tests during transesterification. The quantitative relationship function between input (molar ratio of methanol to oil, catalyst concentration, and temperature) and % yield of methyl ester as an output of the process was developed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) was utilized to develop a prognostic model with good prediction effectiveness. MORSM (multi-objective response surface methodology) was also used to build a prediction model using correlations. A set of statistical indicators and Theil's U2 were used to examine the prediction efficacy and model uncertainty of ANFIS and MORSM. On both statistical indices and Theil's U2, the ANFIS-based model outperformed. To get the best results, the desirability approach was used to improve operating parameters. According to the desirability approach, the best operating parameters were catalyst concentration at 2.09%, methanol to oil ratio at 9.17%, and temperature at 60.49 °C, which resulted in the greatest yield of 91%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Achieving high sustainability levels in the energy sector is at the heart of the United Nations and European Union goals. One of the main paths to achieve this is to adopt sustainable practices in energy supply chains (SCs). In this study, a systematic literature review has been carried out to analyze the triple-bottom-line of sustainability in the SCs of energy production. The main results show that the literature on the topic is scarce and unbalanced. For instance, the analysis of different energy sources is biased towards biomass. Moreover, key SC management aspects like inter-organizational coordination and certain stakeholder involvement i.e., customers, universities and/or research centers, are underrepresented in the analyzed literature. The study's main contribution is to identify and critically review the current key topics and gaps in the literature on sustainability in energy SCs. Based on the findings, a two-level research agenda is proposed that outlines six critical avenues that bring research, private actors, and decision-makers altogether to enhance the sustainability of energy SCs. The suggestions for future research included in the agenda are based on the gaps presented in the results of the literature review, as well as on the research directions highlighted in the analyzed literature. This study offers guidance to managers regarding best practices and fields of improvement, as well as to scholars by suggesting paths to fill gaps in the current body of literature and elaborate more sustainable energy SCs. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The issue of solid waste management is one of the greatest challenges of any society. Instead of leveraging solid waste's potential to produce energy using waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies, different countries especially developing countries stick to their ineffective and inferior methods to dispose of solid wastes. To fill this gap between energy production and waste management, this paper develops a novel methodology that integrates three efficacious tools, including Monte Carlo simulation, multi-attribute decision-making, and mathematical optimisation modelling to solve the problem from the perspective of economy, energy recovery, environment (3E), and social sustainability. In this paper, a multi-attribute decision-making method, namely AHP, is investigated to select the most suitable emerging WTE technological options as well as the optimal waste collection routes, to capture solid waste as a potential renewable energy source. Monte Carlo simulation and beta-PERT distribution are also applied to reduce the uncertainty intrinsic to decision-making. After validating the proposed methodology in a real-world case study of Tehran city, we apply a novel meta-heuristic algorithm namely NSGA-III to solve the problem on large scales with a reasonable computational time. The performance of this algorithm in solving waste location-routing problems is explored by conducting several trials. Highlights Addressing an integrated waste-to-energy and transportation network for solid waste management.

	abstract = {The problems of flexible planning of the design of logistics systems for the collection of food products such as raw milk can result in a decrease in the performance of critical indicators for their performance. This paper proposes a new efficient methodology for robustly designing a first-mile logistics system for storing and refrigerating milk as a perishable product considering decisions related to open facilities and the flow of products, including sustainability indices. The proposed approach is modeled as a bi-objective problem by considering the minimization of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) produced by milk transportation canteens and the maximization of the system configuration's net present value (NPV). We have analyzed and determined the most robust configuration for the first time and explained the robustness-NPV and robustness-CO2 relationships. The proposed mathematical model is solved by the Epsilon constraints method, and the robustness is calculated considering an extension of the FePIA methodology for multiobjective problems. A novel contribution is a balance in the possible future values generated by the company related to its cash flows and the generation of CO2 emissions when using a motorized transport frequently used in the shipment of raw milk considering a new important aspect such as the volume of product transported and the slope of the path between the production farm and the storage cooling tanks. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The social impact assessment (SIA) is considered by the literature to be as important as the assessment of economic impacts, as it allows decision-makers to anticipate the possible social consequences of proposed projects. However, to guide the technology selection process in the context of biorefineries, the evaluation models mostly consider technical, economic, and environmental indicators. The objective of the research is to propose a multicriteria decision model to evaluate the social impact of bioconversion technologies in small- and medium-sized biorefineries. Three phases were considered: (1) technological prospecting, which identified eight bioconversion technologies; (2) application of the SODA method (Strategic Options Development and Analysis), which identified nine basic social criteria; and (3) the PROMETHEE-ROC method, which used the structured model to identify the most appropriate bioconversion technology, considering aspects related to SIA. From a theoretical point of view, the proposed model is the only one to consider in depth the social dimension in decision-making on the adoption of bioconversion technologies. From a managerial point of view, the proposed model allows for optimizing the investment decision process in technologies in the context of small- and medium-sized biorefineries. The results point to the existence of a lack of research aimed at investigating the social aspects of small- and medium-sized biorefineries, which use different technological routes for the production of multiproducts. In addition, the technologies of hydrodynamic cavitation and heterogeneous catalysis are presented as those that can positively impact social issues in territories and consequently generate new business opportunities and healthy living. It is concluded that the absence of an updated and efficient national policy for the development of technologies oriented to the use of biomass, which aim to promote positive social impacts, has caused the impoverishment of communities as well as a proliferation of work analogous to slavery in the different regions of the country. Therefore, the proposed model can be used by decision-makers to simplify the process of evaluating technologies to be used for the bioconversion of raw materials into several high-added-value products in small- and medium-sized biorefineries, as well as to support the implementation of strategies that favor the technological and human development of communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

The study utilized ML models to analyze and forecast waste generation trends, assess the viability of various waste management methods, and develop optimization models for resource allocation and operational efficiency. The research employs the World Bank's comprehensive waste management dataset. After rigorous data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature selection, a variety of ML techniques, such as regression models, classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and optimization algorithms, including linear programming, are applied. Unlike other research, this study achieved 85 % accuracy on predictive analytics models for forecasting waste generation trends, primarily attributed to integrating more diverse data sets, including socio-economic factors. Also, the optimization resource allocation achieved a 15 % increase in operational efficiency. These findings provide significant insights for policymakers and urban planners, suggesting that integrating ML in waste management can lead to more sustainable and cost-effective practices. This paper demonstrates the transformative potential of ML in optimizing waste management strategies, offering a pathway towards more sustainable and economically viable waste management solutions globally. © 2024},

	abstract = {Due to various environmental problems and social impacts caused by biomass supply chains activities such as climate change, increasing energy demand, energy security, and food crisis, on the one hand, and economic issues such as high costs of biomass supply chains logistics activities, and inefficient production of bioenergy products from low-energy density biomass, on the other hand, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have transitioned to a growing area of research in a recent decade. In this perspective, evaluating three aspects of sustainablity, including economic, environmental, and social sustainability, as the main characteristic to review the literature of supply chain design and planning models has been the subject of several review studies, however, modeling and optimization of sustainable biomass supply chains have not been reviewed and analysed so far. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a taxonomic review of biomass to bio-products supply chains design and planning models that evaluate or optimize economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. To this aim, a total number of 178 papers published in scientific journals are categorized and analyzed according to a comprehensive classification framework, including sustainability dimensions, decision level, modeling approach, model characteristic, solution approach, uncertainty modeling approach, and data. Some significant factors ignored in the previous studies such as sustainability aspects, transportation modes, by-products, type of biomass feedstocks, international and governmental factors are considered in this review in order to provide a comprehensive vision for the readers. Finally, the drawbacks and research gaps that have been identified through the literature review are highlighted, and potential directions for future studies are recommended. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Syngas, a sustainable fuel produced from biomass, often contains a significant proportion of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The viability of syngas, as a substitute for petroleum diesel fuel in a dual-fuel (DF) diesel engine is crucial to evaluate considering its combustive properties and environmental benefits. Artificial intelligence-based methods are widely used to optimize engine operations but are still rare in DF syngas/diesel engines. This study introduces a novel methodology combining the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to optimize engine load, compression ratio (CR), and injection timing (IT). The ANFIS method is utilized to represent the intricate connections between engine parameters and output responses. Meanwhile, the TOPSIS technique is employed to determine the best combination of parameters that will maximize brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and pilot fuel replacement (PFR) and minimize emissions of unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Strong predictive abilities were shown by the ANFIS model, whose coefficients of determination (R2) ranged from 0.86 to 0.96. The experimental findings demonstrate that the use of syngas in DF mode greatly improves BTE, reaching a maximum value of 25.59% under conditions of 100% load, CR of 18, and IT of 29° before top dead centre (BTDC). The ANFIS-TOPSIS algorithm effectively identifies the best operating conditions, which include a 60% load, 17.5 CR, and 29° BTDC. Significantly, the levels of HC and CO emissions decreased to 399.92 ppm and 367.77 ppm, respectively, while the NOX emissions remained at 146.61 ppm. This study innovatively integrates TOPSIS and ANFIS to optimize a syngas-diesel engine, contributing to the knowledge base on alternative fuels, and enabling the development of cleaner and more efficient engines. © 2025 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In recent decades, significant research has been devoted to optimizing sustainable energies to improve their technical performance, economic profitability, and social acceptance. Despite the development and application of numerous heuristic algorithms in the field of sustainable energy, a systematic review of the most popular solvers remains scarce. Therefore, this study developed a Boolean logic-based program in three keyword blocks to conduct a literature search for the applications of heuristic solvers in sustainable energy, investigating their geographic- and topic-based popularity and exploring the factors contributing to their success. After describing the basic concepts and terminology of optimization, the generic applications of 28 standard heuristic algorithms in the current literature on renewable energy were assessed, from which particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms exhibited superior performance. Therefore, the history, structure, and variants of these two algorithms were extensively analyzed to understand the reasons behind their frequent applications in three major sustainable engineering fields: energy integration, buildings, and transportation. The search results revealed that the distinguished articles typically employed the multiobjective and hybrid variants of the two algorithms. The primary impetus for their development was the familiarity of the employing communities rather than the type of optimization problems or search spaces. The first authors were mainly affiliated with China, India, Iran, and the United States, whereas the active higher education institutes were distributed in several regions without a regular pattern. Considering their productive role in publishing advanced research, open-source journals are expected to spearhead future research in this field. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bioenergy is a renewable resource that can replace fossil fuels in process industries to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here, we propose a harmonized approach to study the GHG reduction potential and techno-economic performance of replacing fossil fuel with straw crops in the steel, chemical, and cement industries in China. Based on the statistical analysis of utilizable biomass resources, the GHG emission reduction in three industrial sectors (steel, chemical, and cement) was evaluated, which achieves 0.21 t CO2/t steel, 0.31 t CO2/t crude oil, and 0.12 t CO2/t cement, respectively. Furthermore, the GHG avoidance profits of bioenergy substitution was evaluated through techno-economic analysis considering carbon pricing, which was calculated to be 338.35, 345.25, and 345.96 CNY/t CO2 in steel, chemical and cement industries, respectively. It is estimated that straw utilization in China's industrial sectors would reduce 13.84–18.48 % of the total emission (9900 Mt CO2), together with a carbon trading income of 17673.63–23991.44 billion CNY in 2060. Among the studied provinces, Henan, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu show the greatest potential of generating high GHG avoidance profits. This study provides quantitative guidance for the exploitation of China's straw resources for energy substitution in process industries to alleviate GHG emission. © 2025},

The design of supply chain networks plays a pivotal role in effective supply chain management. Optimal decisions in this area ensure the flexibility and responsiveness of the entire system. Also, the role of supply chains in waste management is crucial as it enables the efficient movement and handling of materials, ensuring proper disposal or recycling. An effective supply chain helps the collection, processing, and distribution of waste, optimizing resource use and minimizing environmental impact. This study developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to manage agricultural waste in the palm date industry, serving as a case study for producing medium-density fiberboards (MDF). It employs a robust optimization approach to enhance the network's adaptability in accommodating uncertainties related to customer demands. Computational analysis is also provided to present the significance of the model.

Two conflicting objectives are considered: the logistics costs of the supply chain and the balance of CO (Formula presented.). Accurate data are used to evaluate the model and the Pareto optimal solutions are produced in scenarios potentially feasible in practice. The solutions showed relevant information to guide decisions about investment in logistic infrastructure. We demonstrated that cleaner transportation routes lead to solutions that have larger carbon stocks with 3–5% increase in costs by only choosing more suitable regions for corn cultivation and transportation modes. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in waste-to-energy technologies, the integration of municipal solid waste in energy recovery systems is becoming a promising alternative. However, it is still unclear how these technologies can be optimally combined, especially when the future price of energy and the quantity of waste are uncertain. Additionally, it remains an open question whether these uncertainties exert a notable impact on the optimal configuration and trade-off between costs and emissions of energy recovery systems. This paper studies a multi-carrier energy infrastructure to generate energy from municipal solid waste, aiming to optimize the selection and size of waste-to-energy technologies. To account for uncertainty in heat, electricity, and hydrogen prices, as well as waste supply in the future, a two-stage robust optimization model is proposed to minimize the total annual cost (including an environmental penalty) of the waste-to-energy facility. On a real test case in Nova Scotia, Canada, the solution obtained from the robust model led to a 19.9% decrease in emissions compared to that of the deterministic model, albeit with an increase in total cost under the current prices. Plasma arc gasification is selected as the optimal technology in the deterministic case, but pyrolysis outperforms it when the cost of hydrogen sufficiently decreases. Moreover, the viability of hydrogen production hinges upon a 36% reduction in its cost or a 90% decrease in energy operating costs. The outcomes of this investigation furnish compelling proof regarding the influence of parameter uncertainties on both optimal system design and performance. They also showcase the efficacy of the proposed framework for selecting waste-to-energy technologies, and highlight the circumstances that prompt a change in the optimal technology mix. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, a multi-period model of an organic waste-to-biodiesel phased supply chain network is developed to strategically consider variations in the biodiesel demand and the organic waste usage over a long-term planning interval. The proposed model can facilitate planning to determine the biorefinery location and the amount of biodiesel to produce, transport, or utilize to reduce the total cost of the organic waste-to-biodiesel supply chain network design while meeting the biodiesel demand during each period of the planning interval. The features and capabilities of the model are validated by application of a future organic waste-to-biodiesel supply chain network design in South Korea. The optimization results illustrate that the average total annual cost of the organic waste of biodiesel based on the multi-period model will be $US 4.2 billion per year during the period 2020–2030. The minimum selling prices for the optimal network design were determined ranged from $US 3.154–3.156/gallon of biodiesel containing 3% butanol derived from organic waste combined with diesel. A small portion (4.9–6.6%) of the total biodiesel demand was produced from organic waste because of low organic waste availability in the existing anaerobic digestion facilities, leading to increasing the outsourcing costs of butanol. The proposed approach will facilitate the strategic development of a sustainable supply chain network for organic waste recycling for material and energy valorization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Integrated optimization of the biogas generation system is essential for a speedy and environmentally friendly transition to sustainable biodiesel production.

Firstly, the energy supply and demand model of biomass waste of domestic residual waste and kitchen waste is studied, and biomass disposal facilities are taken as the flexible resource of MEMG. Then, a multi-energy storage system is established for flexible regulation according to the fluctuating demand of multi-energy in MEMG. Considering the uncertainties of biomass waste production by residents, renewable energy output, and multi-energy load, a MEMG multi-objective robust optimal scheduling model is established with the objectives of minimizing operating costs and maximizing waste disposal. Finally, a numerical example simulation is carried out with a MEMG in Northeast China.

The lower level combines the operating characteristics of THESS to minimize the operating cost and wind and solar curtailment. The bi-level optimization is solved by GUROBI and MOBWO-VIKOR method. Finally, case studies are conducted to verify the validity and feasibility of the model. The results show that the proposed model can achieve new energy consumption of 97.5 % while the net benefit to 1270.18 billion CNY and reduce the operating costs over the planning period. This study can provide useful suggestions for the investment and construction of multi-energy coupling projects. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current study offers a sustainable supply chain model that can be used to identify opportunities and constraints for the future of the microalgae-based bio-diesel and bio-plastic industry. The network's carbon emissions are restricted by an uncertain constraint that allows for flexibility in controlling emissions as needed. The social constraints of the model provides a transparent depiction of labour needs in dynamic business landscape and foster women's empowerment through a preference coefficient. The proposed model introduces a new upside risk measures under fuzzy-stochastic setting to quantify the upward financial risk. To characterize and manage the model uncertainty, a fuzzy-stochastic distributional robust model is presented. Credibility distribution is utilized to handle fuzzy uncertainty, while box and polyhedral uncertainty sets are included to handle stochastic uncertainty. After that, tractable deterministic formulations of the uncertain model for two ambiguity sets are presented to solve the model. Finally, a number of insights are obtained by means of five test problems that are implemented in Python and resolved by one exact and five meta-heuristic algorithms. Experiments indicate that, when faced with uncertainty, two robust models have produced more stable solutions (16.23% and 19.67% higher stability, respectively) than nominal stochastic model. Further, a 4.68% decline in total cost and 3.27% increment in bio-diesel production can be achieved by increasing bio-diesel conversion rate to 10%. In addition, a 9.09% downturn in total cost and 10.44% rise in bio-plastic production can be obtained by 10% increment in bio-plastic conversion rate. Moreover, 45.38% more woman labours can be recruited by increasing the preference coefficient from −0.2 to +0.2. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Global warming and other environmental issues brought on by the usage of fossil fuels and the unsustainable urban population development have prompted energy industry policymakers to look for renewable sources to create clean energy. Biogas production from agro-livestock waste is a sustainable renewable bioenergy option for overcoming fossil fuel depletion. Since there are a few considerations of sustainable development goals, all air contaminants during the network activities, uncertainties in critical parameters, and crucial strategic and operational decisions in a cohesive framework at the same time in the design of bioenergy systems, this research intends to establish a bioenergy supply chain network by constructing biogas plants to produce both bioelectricity and bio-fertilizer from agricultural and livestock waste. In order to design a profit maximizing, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible supply chain, a multi-objective mathematical model is elaborated to decide strategic and operational decisions of the bioenergy supply chain with the objectives of maximizing network profits, minimizing the environmental impacts of transportation and production, and maximizing the job opportunities generated by the designed network. The uncertainty of key parameters such as costs, revenues, availability of agro-livestock waste, maximum allowable budget, and demands are considered. An approach based on the fuzzy programming method is used to handle the uncertainty. The mathematical model is solved by combining a group best–worst method with a fuzzy goal programming approach. The model is tested using actual data from the Iranian province of Fars and various agro-livestock waste, such as rice straw, wheat straw, maize straw, cow manure, and hen manure. According to the findings, 87.2% of the total network income comes from the sale of bioelectricity, which accounts for the biggest share of network revenues. Most of the network’s overall costs are related to setting up facilities, supplying materials, and production. The biogas plant activities produce the majority of the expected network’s emissions and the built-in biogas plants and their operation unquestionably generate the largest employment opportunities. In addition, although the system’s profit is somewhat reduced by taking into account the sustainable development goals, the environmental and social objectives are much enhanced.

Food waste treatment requires the authority's financial support because of its high costs and the treatment methods need to be further explored, but there is no effective approach to help the authority determine reasonable subsidy mechanisms and help enterprises to identify the technology application strategies. Therefore, a bi-level optimization model was constructed to find decision strategies that would satisfy both parties in the interaction between the local authority's subsidy design and the food waste treatment plant's identification of technology applications, where a mixed subsidy mechanism and technology integrations were considered. The proposed model was applied to a case study in Shanghai, China to investigate its feasibility and applicability. The influence of total amount of food waste and the related attitude of the local authority were analysed and discussed. Some management suggestions for different decision makers were proposed. It was found that while performance subsidies are preferred over transport and treatment subsidies, mixed subsidies are more favourable. Multi-technology integration facilitates the treatment plants's profitability, and the share of technology application needs to be determined based on the actual. Food waste treatment systems can reduce carbon emissions while achieving energy self-sufficiency. © 2023},

The source separation process reduces waste separation costs and improves the quality of recycled products by preventing the generation of mixed waste and assisting the waste recycling process. The purpose of this paper is to present a multi-period, multi-objective model for designing an integrated and sustainable supply chain network for municipal solid waste management that considers source separation and employs a reward-penalty mechanism. The objective functions include minimizing the system's total cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and adverse environmental impacts on residential areas. The proposed model is illustrated through a case study in Kermanshah, Iran. Three scenarios including the optimal solution of the proposed model considering the landfill location as a decision variable, the optimal solution of the proposed model with the current landfill location fixed, and the existing waste management system are introduced and compared. The results indicate that when the proposed system is used instead of the previous two scenarios, waste management costs are reduced by 12.4% and 66.6%, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 0.5%, and increased by 3.3%. Environmental impacts are increased by 16.5% and reduced by 8.9%, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the effect of varying the waste impurity percentage on supply chain performance, as source separation is believed to reduce system costs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

De-spite this growing interest in AFS, comprehensive analyses of the scholarly literature are hard to find. Therefore, the present systematic review delineated the contours of this growing research strand and analyzed how it relates to sustainability. A search performed on the Web of Science in January 2020 yielded 1389 documents, and 1289 were selected and underwent bibliometric and topical analyses. The topical analysis was informed by the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) approach of FAO and structured along four dimensions viz. environment, economy, society and culture, and policy and governance. The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS. It makes the case for adopting a holistic, 4‐P (planet, people, profit, policy) approach in agri‐food system studies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Sustainable Supply Chain have become a cornerstone to any company that seeks to achieve sustainable goals. A company's image is no longer related to the old paradigm of being sustainable in its own activities, but instead is associated with a strong collaboration between all supply chain stakeholders, towards a sustainable activity. It is then critical to create new methods and tools to account for the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental and social, in a multi-stakeholder chain. In this context, operational research (OR) methods play a key role in supporting sustainable supply chain activities. This paper aims to review the trends and directions of OR methods applications towards the achievement of sustainable supply chain. A set of 220 papers has been reviewed to identify the OR methods being employed, the levels of decision considered and how sustainability practices were treated through OR. We found that optimization models applied to strategic level decisions are the most preponderant studies. Moreover, it was verified that sustainability has been mainly tackled by assessing economic and environmental aspects, leaving behind the social aspects. Additionally, OR-based studies do not yet present a clear definition of sustainability, a fact that is proven by the number of environmental and social methodologies explored. Based on the major trends identified in the literature, a research framework is derived, pointing towards a future research agenda in the area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The present study intends to develop multi-layered feed-forward back-propagation algorithm based artificial neural network (FFBPNN) models to predict the synthesis gas (SG) compositions (H2, CH4, CO & CO2) and yields (mol/kg) for supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of food wastes. Such models are trained with Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm, minimized using gradient descent approach and tested with real-time experimental datasets obtained from literature. Moreover, to determine an optimal form of the neural network for a typical non-catalytic SCWG process, a trial and error approach involving multiple combinations of transfer functions and neurons in the network layers is performed. The predicted values of SG compositions yield delivered by the FFBPNN models are in line with the experimental datasets converging to a mean squared error (MSE) value below 0.300 range and coefficient of determination (R2) above 98%. Best prediction accuracy is achieved for CO yield prediction characterized by a least MSE of 0.022 and highest train-test R2 of 0.9942–0.9939. The performance of the developed FFBPNN models can be arranged on the basis of MSE as (ann7)CO < (ann6)CH₄ < (ann5)H₂ < (ann8)CO₂ and on the basis of testing R2 as (ann7)CO > (ann6)CH₄ > (ann5)H₂ > (ann8)CO₂. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Energy is a fundamental element supporting societal development, particularly with the increasing dependency on the Internet of Things. It is also the main contributor to environmental impacts and subsequently, a potential sector for mitigation. Sustainable energy system design considers energy savings and energy efficiency, waste and consumption reduction, process efficiency enhancement, waste heat recovery, and integration of renewable energy. Emerging tools range from advanced Process Integration, modelling, simulation, and optimisation, to system analysis and assessment. This review covers selected emerging studies promoting sustainable system design, including the recent developments reported in the Special Issue (SI) of the 22nd Conference on Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction (PRES’19). The primary emphasis was to enhance the economic and environmental performance. However, social factors were also highlighted as essential for future sustainable development. The discussion and analysis in this review focus on the most recent developments of (a) heat integration and heat transfer; (b) integrated and newly developed heat exchangers, (c) integration of renewables, and (d) roles in economic and environmental sustainability. The key results are highlighted, and future research ideas are suggested according to their links to a broader context. © 2020 by the authors.},

Furthermore, we consider the effects of feedstock purity on the economic feasibility of the waste-to-energy system, and extend our model to develop planning solutions that can achieve specified profit targets as best possible in the presence of feedstock purity uncertainty. To solve the optimization model efficiently, a three level solution framework, consisting of a binary search method, a one-dimensional parameter search and a Benders decomposition algorithm is proposed. Computational studies give positive demonstrations of our proposed model in providing the requisite decision support in WTE systems planning problems.},

	abstract = {This study determines the potential barriers to achieving circularity in dairy supply chains; it proposes a framework which covers big data driven solutions to deal with the suggested barriers. The main contribution of the study is to propose a framework by making ideal matching and ranking of big data solutions to barriers to circularity in dairy supply chains. This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions. The results indicate that among the main barriers, ‘economic’ was of the highest importance, followed by ‘technological’, ‘environmental’, ‘strategic’, ‘supply chain management’ then ‘social and legal barrier’ in dairy supply chains. In order to overcome circularity focused barriers, ‘optimization’ is determined to be the most important big data solution. The other solutions to overcoming proposed challenges are ‘data mining’, ‘machine learning’, ‘statistical techniques’ and ‘artificial neural network’ respectively. The suggested big data solutions will be useful for policy makers and managers to deal with potential barriers in implementing circularity in the context of dairy supply chains. © 2021},

	abstract = {Does the Earth contain enough oil to provide energy for the human race indefinitely? If not, how long will the oil last? What about renewable energy technologies like wind and solar? Will they be able to supply an indefinite supply of energy for the human race? If not, how long will it last? And what role does overpopulation play in our world's energy supply? Even with multiple forms of energy available, how long will it last as long as more and more humans, and therefore more industries and energy consumption, are added? Taking a long-held theory called "Peak Oil Theory" the authors of this groundbreaking new text examine the theory of "Peak Energy" to examine all of these questions. Crude oil and natural gas are the major sources of fuel used to supply energy for various needs. Users of crude oil and natural gas must take into account that these energy sources are, without doubt, non-renewable depleting resources, and the cost of extraction depends not only on the current rate of production but also on the amount of cumulative production. In fact, many pundits believe projections that the world is rapidly apprpaching a precipice, after which crude oil and natural gas will no longer be in ready supply. This phenomenon has given rise to the peak oil theory - peak oil is the point in time when the maximum rate of petroleum recovery from the reservoir is reached, after which the rate of petroleum production enters terminal decline. From this concept has emerged the wider concept of the peak energy theory which, as it is related to the availability of all fossil fuels, is also subject to decline with fossil fuel use. This text, written by two of the world's most well-known, respected, and prolific writers in the energy industry, is a fascinating study of our world's energy needs and the future of the multi-source energy supply on this planet. Whether oil and gas, wind, solar, geothermal, or even nuclear, all sources of energy have their limits, and we, as scientists, engineers, and consumers of energy need to be knowledgeable on these topics. This book is a must-have for any engineer, student, scientist, or even layperson interested in energy and the idea of energy sustainability on planet Earth. © 2016 by Scrivener Publishing LLC.

This paper addresses the design of a WCO-for-biodiesel supply chain at both strategic and tactical levels. The supply chain of this problem is studied, which is based on a typical mode of the waste collection (from restaurants’ kitchen) and conversion in the cities. The supply chain comprises three stakeholders: WCO supplier, integrated bio-refinery and demand zone. Three key problems should be addressed for the optimal design of the supply chain: (1) the number, sizes and locations of bio-refinery; (2) the sites and amount of WCO collected; (3) the transportation plans of WCO and biodiesel. A robust mixed integer linear model with muti-objective (economic, environmental and social objectives) is proposed for these problems. Finally, a large-scale practical case study is adopted based on Suzhou, a city in the east of China, to verify the proposed models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The system analysis tools applied to design and assess the performance of linear IWMSs were reviewed in order to identify the weak spots of these methodologies, the difficulties of applying them to CIWMSs, and the topics that could benefit from further research and standardization.

Therefore, there is an imperative need for resilient and effective resource management that considers societal, environmental and economic components of sustainable development. In this regard, adopting a EWF Nexus approach that considers the interactions between sectors is fundamental. However, it requires the additional mobilisation of particular decision-making tools in order to completely address the question of resource utilisation. In fact, well-studied decision-making methodologies are necessary to sustain resources, address multi-scale challenges and ensure robust governance of EWF Nexus systems. This study highlights the current literature regarding the modelling approaches used for dynamic decision-making within the EWF Nexus focusing on mathematical optimisation, agent-based modelling and game theory. These algorithmic frameworks serve as strategic guidelines for policy makers and encourage effective decision-making related to maximising targets and minimising environmental burdens. Outcomes of this study demonstrate the complementary relationships that exist between the decision-making models highlighted, and how together with a EWF Nexus approach can be used for integrated resource management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Dilute acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass depolymerizes xylan into xylose and lignin into acid-soluble lignin (ASL). Xylose is a desired product, while the lignin fraction can be reduced by producing ASL, since lignin is a non-competitive inhibitor for enzymatic hydrolysis. The optimal conditions for depolymerization of xylan into xylose and lignin into ASL differ during acid pretreatment of bagasse. Hence, multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs) were formulated for a batch reactor considering temperature as the decision variable. Two different MOOP studies, namely maximization of the weighted sum of final xylose and ASL yields, and minimization of weighted deviation of final xylose and ASL yields around a targeted value, were considered. The optimal temperature varied between 143.2 °C and 113.1 °C along the Pareto front for static optimization. The batch time minimization problem reduced batch time by 32% to achieve desired xylose yield. Dynamic optimization provided minimal benefits over static optimization. Stochastic optimization considering expected uncertainties showed that uncertainties in kinetic parameters impacted results selectively. The optimal temperature decreased by 10 °C for ± 15% variability in kinetic parameters for ASL yield maximization, while it changed marginally for xylose yield maximization. Stochastic optimization showed benefits over static optimization for large variability in kinetic parameters. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Biomass waste is a naturally occurring agricultural byproduct. It is estimated that about 60 million tons per year can be extracted sustainably without altering land use patterns or competing with existing demands. Utilizing this waste is logistically challenging due to the inherent low density and distributed availability of biomass. This work proposes a supply chain optimization problem which decides where to locate and relocate mobile and modular production units to convert biomass waste to energy. Both deterministic and two-stage stochastic formulations are presented, accounting for the inherent uncertainty of where and how much biomass is produced. The framework is applied to case studies analyzing the states of Minnesota and North Carolina. Results from both states show that mobile production modules lead to supply chain cost savings of 1–4%, or millions of dollars per year. Additionally, this work demonstrates the benefit of mobile modules as a means of protecting against uncertainty. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation of Activated Sludge Systems - Second Edition provides, from the process engineering perspective, a comprehensive and up-to-date overview regarding various aspects of the mechanistic (“white box”) modelling and simulation of advanced activated sludge systems performing biological nutrient removal. In the new edition of the book, a special focus is given to nitrogen removal and the latest developments in modelling the innovative nitrogen removal processes. Furthermore, a new section on micropollutant removal has been added. The focus of modelling has been shifting in the last years to models that can describe the performance of a whole plant (plantwide modelling). The expanded part of this new edition introduces models describing the most important processes interrelated with the mainstream activated sludge systems as well as models describing the energy balance, operating costs and environmental impact. The complex process evaluation, including minimization of energy consumption and carbon footprint, is in line with the present and future wastewater treatment goals. By combining a general introduction and a textbook, this book serves both intermediate and more experienced model users, both researchers and practitioners, as a comprehensive guide to modelling and simulation studies.

It provides an exhaustive description of the classification of biorefineries, considering aspects such as systems, technological implementation status, size, feedstocks, platforms, products, and conversion processes. It outlines the main methodologies for designing biorefineries – conceptual design, optimization, and the ‘early stage’ method. Methodologies for the economic, environmental, and social assessment of a biorefinery are presented. Finally, challenges linked to the implementation of biorefinery projects at industrial level are discussed.

	abstract = {In the past few decades, solid waste management systems in Europe have involved complex and multi-faceted trade-offs among a plethora of technological alternatives, economic instruments, and regulatory frameworks. These changes resulted in various environmental, economic, social, and regulatory impacts in waste management practices which not only complicate regional policy analysis, but also reshape the paradigm of global sustainable development. Systems analysis, a discipline that harmonizes these integrated solid waste management strategies, has been uniquely providing interdisciplinary support for decision making in this area. Systems engineering models and system assessment tools, both of which enrich the analytical framework of waste management, were designed specifically to handle particular types of problems. Though how to smooth out the barriers toward achieving appropriate systems synthesis and integration of these models and tools to aid in the solid waste management schemes prevalent in European countries still remains somewhat uncertain. This paper conducts a thorough literature review of models and tools illuminating possible overlapped boundaries in waste management practices in European countries and encompassing the pros and cons of waste management practices in each member state of the European Union. Whereas the Southern European Union (EU) countries need to develop further measures to implement more integrated solid waste management and reach EU directives, the Central EU countries need models and tools with which to rationalize their technological choices and management strategies. Nevertheless, considering systems analysis models and tools in a synergistic way would certainly provide opportunities to develop better solid waste management strategies leading to conformity with current standards and foster future perspectives for both the waste management industry and government agencies in European Union. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recovery of resources from waste streams present important opportunities in mitigating environmental and energy challenges in many countries. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based approach to study the robustness of resource recovery systems in achieving economic feasibility under feedstock uncertainty. Two key characteristics of the feedstock that influence recovery performance are its volume and composition. We propose models of feedstock robustness functions to perform robustness analysis with respect to these two characteristics, and also propose a composite robustness index as the optimization criterion for the problem of technology and capacity planning of recovery systems. We show that the proposed models have computationally attractive reformulations for the robustness analysis and optimization problems. In particular, the robustness analysis model solves either a small number of linear programs in several special cases, or a small number of linear mixed integer programs in general. Correspondingly, the design optimization problem can be solved either via the solution of a small number of linear mixed integer programs, or via a cutting plane approach. Finally, we demonstrate, through some numerical studies, the insights and values of using the proposed models in evaluation and optimization of organic waste-to-energy recovery systems. © 2018 Production and Operations Management Society},

	abstract = {Natural resources and their constituting systems continue to experience stresses attributed to expanding anthropogenic activities. Economic expenditures on most sectors are heavily dependent on water, energy and food resources, the utilisation of which contributes to resource depletion and environmental burdens. The energy–water–food (EWF) nexus is a concept that harnesses the intrinsic relationships existing between resources and representative sub-systems in order to support efficient resources management, develop resilience and enhance environmental consciousness. While the EWF nexus framework can provide preliminary decision-making insights into resource sub-systems, it cannot alone address modern-day multidimensional resource problems and their related economic and environmental challenges. Food insecurity, a global challenge for mankind, is a result of various factors, of which is resource mismanagement. This chapter investigates the possibility of understanding and alleviating food insecurity by means of the EWF nexus approach. It highlights using case studies the possible analytical and modelling decision-making tools that enable the characterisation and analysis of resources systems across strategic, tactical and operational levels of decision-making in volatile and risky environments. Example of studies involve optimisation, machine learning and agent-based modelling, and illustrate the complementary nature of these tools within decision frameworks, and how they can be utilised to alleviate food insecurity and support sustainable and resilient resource management. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Challenges of high energy efficiency, water saving, low-carbon emissions, waste management and food saving have been considerable pressures on both regional and global sustainable development. This paper reviews the water-energy extended nexuses (e.g. food, greenhouse gases, waste, pollution, land and others) from the perspective of relationship and practicability in relieving the challenges towards environmentally-related sustainable development goals. A specific issue identified is that with the popularity of “nexus” and extension beyond resources nexus, the positioning and identity of nexuses become ambiguous. In most cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace specific expressions such as multi-criteria optimisation, trade-offs, correlation/relationship, input-output assessment, material flow analysis, and integrated design. The methodologies (e.g. input-output analysis and life cycle assessment) entail needing to be adequately integrated or expanded for diverse water-energy extended nexuses. It is crucial for evaluating resource flows in multiple regions and sectors and assessing the associated environment-economic impacts. A standardised understanding like establishing life cycle assessment and even more quantified footprints could ensure that the nexus would not fall as the group of a buzzword and contribute to sustainable development goals. This study serves as a stepping stone to establish quantified characteristics or components as eligibility to classify as nexus approaches and studies. © 2021},

	abstract = {Urban energy system planning (UESP) is a topic of growing concern for cities in deregulated energy markets, which plan to decrease energy demand, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy sources. UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem's context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods in the context of UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and the rationales for selecting and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems. The final outcome is a synthesis of the data and insights obtained, which may help potential users identify appropriate decision analysis methods based on given problem characteristics. © 2017 Cajot, Mirakyan, Koch and Maréchal.},

Nevertheless, at the early stage of the project, decisions must be made concerning the network used to supply biomass to the anaerobic co-digestion facility. However, these decisions involve complex hierarchical processes, taking into account the best compromise to be found among diverse factors and actors (economic, social, environmental, etc.). In this article a systematic approach integrating Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization and Analytical Hierarchical Process is proposed. It will allow project managers to evaluate possible scenarios for the implementation of an anaerobic co-digestion logistics network in order to facilitate the integration of the preferences of the stakeholders involved in the project.

	abstract = {Waste production is constantly increasing worldwide and constitutes a problem that is expected to deteriorate in the future. In parallel, ensuring access to affordable and sustainable energy for all is crucial considering current environmental, economic, and social concerns. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) is an effective solution to address both issues, therefore it requires intense scientific attention. WtE management is characterized by different technologies, refers to various waste types, and needs multidisciplinary decision support. Thus, it is critical to include multiple criteria in the decision making process i.e. economic, technological, environmental, social, and political. These reflect different objectives that often come into conflict with each other. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a tool that can effectively contribute to answer that challenge. The paper reviews the way, the scope, and the multi-criteria techniques that have been applied up-to-now to WtE Management Strategies (WtEMSs) in the globe. A critical review of 153 published papers addresses specific issues and questions. Asian and European countries are producing the most MCDAs studies on WtEMS. An increasing trend of papers commences from the year 2007. Results depict that Analytical Hierarchy Process is the most common approach, adopted in 62 real-life cases. Incineration and anaerobic digestion are mostly studied in MCDA frameworks. Emphasis is given on critical analysis and lessons that can be learnt from the available literature. Policy makers are motivated to: (i) adopt MCDA to holistically make WtEMSs decisions, (ii) adapt to local characteristics, (iii) encounter logistic problems, and (iv) efficiently promote implementation in real-life cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The consumption of fossil fuels has exponentially increased in recent decades, despite significant air pollution, environmental deterioration challenges, health problems, and limited resources. Biofuel can be used instead of fossil fuel due to environmental benefits and availability to produce various energy sorts like electricity, power, and heating or to sustain transportation fuels. Biodiesel production is an intricate process that requires identifying unknown nonlinear relationships between the system input and output data; therefore, accurate and swift modeling instruments like machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) are necessary to design, handle, control, optimize, and monitor the system. Among the biodiesel production modeling methods, machine learning provides better predictions with the highest accuracy, inspired by the brain's autolearning and self-improving capability to solve the study's complicated questions; therefore, it is beneficial for modeling (trans) esterification processes, physicochemical properties, and monitoring biodiesel systems in real-time. Machine learning applications in the production phase include quality optimization and estimation, process conditions, and quantity. Emissions composition and temperature estimation and motor performance analysis investigate in the consumption phase. Fatty methyl acid ester stands as the output parameter, and the input parameters include oil and catalyst type, methanol-to-oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time, domain, and frequency. This paper will present a review and discuss various ML technology advantages, disadvantages, and applications in biodiesel production, mainly focused on recently published articles from 2010 to 2021, to make decisions and optimize, model, control, monitor, and forecast biodiesel production. © 2021 Yuanzhi Xing et al.},

	abstract = {The staggering rate of waste generation due to industrialization, urbanization and population growth has raised a pressing problem regarding environmental damages and human health hazards, especially in developing nations. Severe environmental and social risks such as surface and groundwater pollution, soil and air contamination, serious human health hazards and damage to aesthetic aspects are some inappropriate waste management results. To overcome these burdens and move toward sustainable municipal solid waste management, effective and efficient practices are required. This study deals with a sustainable municipal solid waste network design problem under uncertainty. For this purpose, a multi-objective fuzzy robust programming model with the aim of minimizing the total costs of the network and environmental damages and optimizing social impacts is proposed. Different practical waste treatment practices are considered in the proposed network, including incineration, recycling, composting and sanitary landfilling. Also, a risk that is related to the population of facilities’ potential location is introduced and the Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is applied to determine the value of the mentioned risk. In order to tackle uncertain parameters of the proposed model, the Fuzzy Robust Optimization approach is applied. The proposed multi-objective model solves as a single-objective model using the Fuzzy Goal Programming approach with Different Importance and Priorities. The applicability of the model is demonstrated through a real case study of Minudasht's municipal solid waste management system. The optimal location with the least risk and environmental impacts for each treatment facility with related technology and method is introduced. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has done on some parameters to determine the effect of parameters’ changes on objective functions. The results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Experiments were performed with various types of organic waste and sewage sludge, such as different types of sewage sludge from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants, waste from vegetable oil, wine, dairy and meat processing industry, lignocellulosic waste and bio-plastic waste. The synthesis problem was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and was solved by using General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) software with the main objective of maximizing economic profit. The synthesis is demonstrated on an illustrative case study of up to three biogas plants in Slovenia. Three scenarios were considered with different prices of waste materials. The study showed good agreement between the model and experimental results. Results demonstrated that biogas production could be profitable by using considered waste materials only if biogas plant was paid for processing the substrates. Up to 6 GWh/y of electricity could be produced with the profit of about 2∙106 $/y where prices of waste materials were around 80 $/t. Copyright © 2021, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

	abstract = {Designing Green Supply Chains (GSCs) requires complex decision-support models that can deal with multiple dimensions of sustainability while taking into account specific characteristics of products and their supply chain. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches can be used to quantify trade-offs between economic, social, and environmental criteria i.e. to identify green production options. The aim of this paper is to review the use of MCDM approaches for designing efficient and effective GSCs. We develop a conceptual framework to find relevant publications and to categorise papers with respect to decision problems, indicators, and MCDM approaches. The analysis shows that (1) the use of MCDM approaches for designing GSCs is a rather new but emerging research field, (2) most of the publications focus on production and distribution problems, and there are only a few inventory models with environmental considerations, (3) the majority of papers assume all data to be deterministic, (4) little attention has been given to minimisation of waste, (5) numerous indicators are used to account for eco-efficiency, indicating the lack of standards. This study, therefore, identifies the need for more multi-criteria models for real-life GSCs, especially with inclusion of uncertainty in parameters that are associated with GSCs. © 2016, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Eco-industrial parks provide a platform for the application of industrial symbiosis where the synergistic network of companies reuse portions of their by-products to reduce disposed waste, reduce environmental emissions, and improve plant efficiency. However, designing a complex network of material and energy exchanges between companies in an industrial park while satisfying multiple conflicting objectives require a systematic design methodology. In addition, strategic decision-making in an eco-industrial park involves the selection of prospective companies (i.e., support tenants), which complement the existing companies (i.e., anchor tenants). In this study, a fuzzy mixed-integer non-linear programming model is proposed to select prospective support tenants in an eco-industrial park while satisfying the product demand, minimizing the environmental footprint of the eco-industrial park, and also maximizing the annualized profit of each company in the eco-industrial park. A hypothetical but realistic case study involving an algae-based eco-industrial park is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results demonstrate the selection of the appropriate support tenants for the algae-based eco-industrial park together with the optimal plant configuration. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the performance of the algae-based eco-industrial park with respect to the changes in prices of the by-products. The developed model thus aid the planners of an eco-industrial park in assessing which among the prospective support tenants would best complements an existing anchor tenant. Furthermore, the model can also identify price negotiation points between tenants for some product streams which may show sensitivity on the plant capacity of each tenant. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of urban populations and concomitant increase in the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) exert considerable pressure on the conventional centralized MSW management system and are beginning to exceed disposal capacities. To tackle this issue, the conventional centralized MSW management system is more likely to evolve toward a more decentralized system with smaller capacity waste treatment facilities that are integrated at different levels of the urban environment, e.g., buildings, districts, and municipalities. In addition, MSW can become an important urban resource to address the rising energy consumption through waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies capable of generating electricity, heat, and biogas. This shift toward the combined centralized-decentralized waste-to-energy management system (WtEMS) requires an adapted decision-support methodology (DSM) that can assist decision-makers in analyzing MSW generation across large urban territories and designing optimal long-term WtEMS. The proposed integrated DSM for WtEMS planning relies on: i) an MSW segregation and prediction methodology, ii) an optimization methodology for the deployment of multi-level urban waste infrastructure combining centralized and decentralized facilities, and iii) a multi-criterion sustainability framework for WtEMS assessment. The proposed DSM was tested on a case study that was located in Singapore. The proposed WtEMS not only reduced the total operational expenses by about 50%, but also increased revenues from electricity recovery by two times in comparison with the conventional MSW management system. It also allowed more optimal land use (capacity-land fragmentation was reduced by 74.8%) and reduced the size of the required transportation fleet by 15.3% in comparison with the conventional MSW system. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was improved by about 18.7%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},
