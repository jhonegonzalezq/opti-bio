	abstract = {Spatially explicit data layers of tree species assemblages, referred to as forest types or forest type groups, are a key component in large-scale assessments of forest sustainability, biodiversity, timber biomass, carbon sinks and forest health monitoring. This paper explores the utility of coupling georeferenced national forest inventory (NFI) data with readily available and spatially complete environmental predictor variables through spatially-varying multinomial logistic regression models to predict forest type groups across large forested landscapes. These models exploit underlying spatial associations within the NFI plot array and the spatially-varying impact of predictor variables to improve the accuracy of forest type group predictions. The richness of these models incurs onerous computational burdens and we discuss dimension reducing spatial processes that retain the richness in modeling. We illustrate using NFI data from Michigan, USA, where we provide a comprehensive analysis of this large study area and demonstrate improved prediction with associated measures of uncertainty. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2009.},

	abstract = {Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A surging demand for sustainable energy and the urgency to lower greenhouse gas emissions is driving industrial systems towards more eco-friendly and cost-effective models. Biogas from agricultural and municipal organic waste is gaining momentum as a renewable energy source. Concurrently, the European Hydrogen Strategy focuses on green hydrogen for decarbonising the industrial and transportation sectors. This paper presents a multi-objective network design model for urban–industrial symbiosis, incorporating anaerobic digestion, cogeneration, photovoltaic, and hydrogen production technologies. Additionally, a Bayesian best-worst method is used to evaluate the weights of the sustainability aspects by decision-makers, integrating these into the mathematical model. The model optimises industrial plant locations considering economic, environmental, and social parameters, including the net present value, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. The model’s functionalities are demonstrated through a real-world case study based in Emilia Romagna, Italy. It is subject to sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the inputs affect the outcomes and highlights feasible trade-offs through the exploration of the (Formula presented.) -constraint. The findings demonstrate that the model substantially boosts energy and hydrogen production. It is not only economically viable but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with fossil fuels and landfilling. Additionally, it contributes to job creation. This research has significant implications, with potential future studies intended to focus on system resilience, plant location optimisation, and sustainability assessment. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Black carbon (BC) aerosol negatively affects air quality and contributes to climate warming globally. However, little is known about the relative contributions of different source control measures to BC reduction owing to the lack of powerful source-diagnostic tools. We combine the fingerprints of dual-carbon isotope using an optimized Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme and for the first time to study the key sources of BC in megacity Guangzhou of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China in 2018 autumn season. The MCMC model-derived source apportionment of BC shows that the dominant contributor is petroleum combustion (39%), followed by coal combustion (34%) and biomass burning (27%). It should be noted that the BC source pattern is highly sensitive to the variations of air masses transported with an enhanced contribution of fossil source from the eastern area, suggesting the important impact of regional atmospheric transportation on the BC source profile in the PRD region. Also, we further found that fossil fuel combustion BC contributed 84% to the total BC reduction during 2013–2018. The response of PM2.5 concentration to the 14C-derived BC source apportionment is successfully fitted (r = 0.90) and the results predicted that it would take ∼6 years to reach the WHO PM2.5 guideline value (10 μg m−3) for the PRD region if the emission control measures keep same as they are at present. Taken together, our findings suggest that dual-carbon isotope is a powerful tool in constraining the source apportionment of BC for the evaluations of air pollution control and carbon emission measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Seagrass provides numerous valuable ecosystem services across a wide range of climatic regions. However, in terms of area and habitat, this resource is in decline globally and there is an urgent need for accurate mapping of extant meadows and biomass to support sustainable seagrass blue carbon conservation and management. This study develops a novel method for a binary mapping of seagrass distribution and estimating seagrass above-ground biomass (AGB) by applying a suite of advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms combined with and without a metaheuristic optimization approach (particle swarm optimization–PSO) to various combinations of multispectral (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) remote sensing data. Our results reveal that the Sentinel-1 data has potential for the binary mapping of seagrass meadows using an extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model (scores of precision (P) = 0.82, recall (R) = 0.90, and F 1 = 0.86) but is less effective at estimating AGB. The optimal method for estimation of AGB used both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the XGB model, and PSO optimization (coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0.75, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.35, Akaike information criteria (AIC) = 24.80, Bayesian information criteria (BIC) = 44.70).

	abstract = {This paper describes the fisheries and presents quantitative stock assessments for two stocks of Sardinella in the waters of NW Africa. More robust stock assessments are now possible because of improved sampling in Mauritania and Senegal. Round sardinella (S. aurita), which has a wider distribution than flat sardinella (S. maderensis), is the most important species targeted by the different artisanal and industrial fleets. The industrial fleet is located beyond 13 miles from the coast, taking mainly adults. The average size in the offshore fishery, although it has decreased, remains above 26 cm. The species is also exploited by an artisanal fleet using small purse seiners. Two types of assessment model were applied: a production model and size-based model. The abundance indices were consistent, and showed a continuous decline, increasing in rate in recent years. The Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment (JABBA) model (applied for the first time) appeared to be appropriate for the abundance indices (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 18.3–19.2 % for the two models). The results of the two models are consistent in showing increasing fishing mortality and declining biomass for both stocks over the time series. According to the JABBA model, the situation for the round sardinella stock is now critical (biomass at approximately 5 % of unexploited biomass (B0) and 10 % of biomass capable of producing maximum sustainable yields (Bmsy), with fishing mortality 2.5 times above Fmsy), and the flat sardinella is also overfished and suffering massive overfishing (B estimated at 18 %B0 and 25 %Bmsy, with fishing mortality more than 11 times above Fmsy). The results of the Length-based Bayesian Biomass (LBB) model are much more optimistic. It still concludes that both stocks are suffering overfishing (round sardinella F at ∼1.4 times Fmsy proxy, flat sardinella ∼2.2 times Fmsy proxy), but estimates that only the flat sardinella is overfished (B 28%B0 and 80 %Bmsy), while the round sardinella stock is not overfished (B 40 %B0 and 120 %Bmsy). However, these results are not consistent with the abundance index from acoustic surveys (used in the JABBA model) and overall are thought to be less robust. Signs of heavy exploitation have been observed for round sardinella for several years. This situation has been exacerbated since the arrival in late 2016 in the Mauritanian zone of efficient semi-industrial purse seiners targeting small pelagics. The various indirect assessment models used show a difficult stock situation for the round sardinella, on which many fishing communities in the area depend. Abundance indices from acoustic survey confirm the state of overexploitation of this resource. This situation has directed effort towards the flat sardinella, which is characterized by a more coastal distribution and limited migration. This species has been showing signs of overexploitation since 2019. We highlight this result for flat sardinella, which was previously not thought to be overexploited, and propose that managers should also consider how the estimated maximum sustainable catch and fishing mortality can be appropriately distributed between the different fleets in different countries, to ensure that future industry planning in the countries of the region is compatible with the sustainability of these critical stocks. This is a very complex task, as it involves not only discussions between neighboring countries, but also difficult decisions within countries about the economic and socio-economic importance of different fisheries sectors. It is essential that these reflections start immediately. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Construction of an accurate and reliable prediction model for the volatility changes in energy consumption can provide valuable reference information for policy makers of the government and for the energy industry. In view of this, a novel improved model is developed in this article by integrating the modified state transition algorithm (MSTA) with the Gaussian processes regression (GPR) approach for non-fossil energy consumption predictions for China at the end of the 13th Five-Year Project, in which the MSTA is utilized for effective optimization of hyper-parameters in GPR. Aiming for validating the superiority of MSTA, several comparisons are conducted on two well-known functions and the optimization results show the effectiveness of modification in the state transition algorithm (STA). Then, based on the latest statistical renewable energy consumption data, the MSTA-GPR model is utilized to generate consumption predictions for overall renewable energy and each single renewable energy source, including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other energies, respectively. The forecasting results reveal that the proposed improved GPR can promote the forecasting ability of basic GPR and obtain the best prediction effect among all the other comparison models. Finally, combined with the forecasting results, the trend of each renewable energy source is analyzed. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Pinios River Basin (PRB) is the most intensively cultivated area in Greece, which hosts numerous industries and other anthropogenic activities. The analysis of water samples collected monthly for ∼1 ½ years in eight monitoring sites in the PRB revealed nitrate pollution of organic origin extending from upstream to downstream and occurring throughout the year, masking the signal from the application of synthetic fertilizers. Nitrate concentrations reached up to 3.6 mg/l as NO3−-N, without exceeding the drinking water threshold of ∼11.0 mg/l (as NO3−-N). However, the water quality status was “poor” or “bad” in ∼50 % of the samples based on a local index, which considers the potential impact of nitrate on aquatic biological communities. The δ15Ν-ΝΟ3− and δ18O-NO3− values ranged from +4.4 ‰ to +20.3 ‰ and from −0.5 ‰ to +14.4 ‰, respectively. The application of a Bayesian model showed that the proportional contribution of organic pollution from industries, animal breeding facilities and manure fertilizers exceeded 70 % in most river sites with an overall uncertainty of ∼0.3 (UI90 index). The δ18O-NO3− and its relationship with δ18O-H2O revealed N-cycling and mixing processes, which were difficult to identify apart from the uptake of nutrients by phytoplankton during the growing season and metabolic activities. The strong correlation of δ15Ν-ΝΟ3− values with a Land Use Index (LUI) and a Point Source Index (PSI) highlighted not only the role of non-point nitrate sources but also of point sources of nitrate pollution on water quality degradation, which are usually overlooked. The nitrification of organic wastes is the dominant nitrate source in most rivers in Europe. The systematic monitoring of rivers for nitrate isotopes will help improve the understanding of N-cycling and the impact of these pollutants on ecosystems and better inform policies for protection measures so to achieve good ecological status. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Models of forest growth and yield are frequently used to inform adaptive management decisions aimed at increasing forest resilience or promoting long-term carbon storage. Despite the increasing ecological detail represented in growth and yield models, there remains large variability (uncertainty) in predictions of forest dynamics under global change. Quantifying this uncertainty and accounting for it when making management decisions is integral to sustainable management in the face of changing conditions. However, the structure and complexity of modern growth and yield models make it challenging to quantify uncertainty and propagate it to predictions of forest dynamics under alternative management strategies. To address this challenge, we develop a Bayesian dynamical model informed by continuous forest inventory data that supports the quantification and propagation of uncertainty in predictions of forest dynamics at a stand scale. The model predicts the temporal evolution of the size-species distribution using a matrix projection process model approximating growth, mortality, and regeneration. Disturbance is integrated through its effect on the size-species distribution within a stand providing a flexible framework to represent adaptive management. We apply the model to long-term inventory data from the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine USA to predict multi-decadal biomass dynamics under five alternative management strategies. Predictions are used to identify the management strategy maximizing live aboveground biomass growth and yield over the model period. We conclude by discussing the benefits and challenges of connecting the model to large-scale inventory data and how its predictions can be used to better inform adaptive management decisions. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Understanding fish's spatial behaviors are important for conservation biology under global warming, as one of the direct responses of fish to climate change is the alterations in distribution. We chose Trichiurus japonicus, which is an ecologically and economically important species in the East China Sea (ECS), to study the vicennial responses of demersal fish to climate change. Eight environmental variables (sea bottom temperature, sea bottom salinity, chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface height, bathymetry, distance to the coast, slope data, and Terrain ruggedness index) combined with the annual survey data were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations and stochastic partial differential equations approach under the Bayesian framework to investigate its distribution shifts in spring during 1999–2019. Based on the distribution model, three spatial behavior indicators (center of gravity, Inertia, and Isotropy) were calculated and correlated with six regional climate indicators (Kuroshio index, Taiwan Warm Current Water index, meridional wind, zonal wind, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and El Niño/Southern Oscillation) to study the potential cause of its spatial behaviors. During the study periods, the biomass of T. japonicus declined gradually, with a brief increase in 2003, 2007–2008, and 2015–2017. T. japonicus preferred high salinity, warm and deep-water area. The relatively persistent hotspots of T. japonicus in spring were in the offshore waters of eastern Zhejiang Province. The change in the center of gravity during the study periods was not obvious, which implied that the distribution shifts were not necessarily vulnerable for T. japonicus in response to climate change and it has strong adaptability to the environment. We also found that strong Kuroshio Current and Taiwan Warm Current Water as well as cold phased of El Niño/Southern Oscillation were accompanied by weakened spatial aggregation of T. japonicus. Overall, for these types of fish with relatively persistent hotspots, the establishment of seasonally protected areas will contribute to the sustainable utilization of the species. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A Bayesian source apportionment (SA) method is developed to provide source impact estimates and associated uncertainties. Bayesian-based ensemble averaging of multiple models provides new source profiles for use in a chemical mass balance (CMB) SA of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The approach estimates source impacts and their uncertainties by using a short-term application of four individual SA methods: three receptor-based models and one chemical transport model. The method is used to estimate two seasonal distributions of source profiles that are used in SA for a long-term PM 2.5 data set. For each day in a long-term PM2.5 data set, 10 source profiles are sampled from these distributions and used in a CMB application, resulting in 10 SA results for each day. This formulation results in a distribution of daily source impacts rather than a single value. The average and standard deviation of the distribution are used as the final estimate of source impact and a measure of uncertainty, respectively. The Bayesian-based source impacts for biomass burning correlate better with observed levoglucosan (R2 = 0.66) and water-soluble potassium (R2 = 0.63) than source impacts estimated using more traditional methods and more closely agrees with observed total mass. The Bayesian approach also captures the expected seasonal variation of biomass burning and secondary impacts and results in fewer days with sources having zero impact. Sensitivity analysis found that using non-informative prior weighting performed better than using weighting based on method-derived uncertainties. This approach can be applied to long-term data sets from speciation network sites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to providing results that are more consistent with independent observations and known emission sources being present, the distributions of source impacts can be used in epidemiologic analyses to estimate uncertainties associated with the SA results. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of methane generation in landfills is crucial for effective greenhouse gas management and energy recovery, requiring site-specific assessments due to the inherent variability in waste composition and properties before and after disposal. This study investigates the uncertainties associated with methane generation predictions by employing a combination of stoichiometric methods, Biochemical Methane Potential (BMP) assays, and Bayesian inference. Fresh and aged (1-year-old and 5-year-old) samples collected in the tropical Saravan dump site in Gilan, Iran, were used to evaluate the waste’s methane generation potential and degradation rate in the field. The average methane generation potential (L0) for fresh samples by the stoichiometric simplified method was 83.4 m3 CH4/Mg MSW, which decreased to 44.8 m3 CH4/Mg MSW and 32.8 m3 CH4/Mg MSW for 1-year-old and 5-year-old waste samples, respectively. The BMP tests led to similar results, further validating the decreasing trend of L0 with waste age. The Bayesian approach combined with MCMC simulations revealed that uncertainty in methane estimation is highest in the early years and gradually declines as waste stabilizes, improving long-term prediction accuracy. By integrating sensitivity analysis with Bayesian inference, this study advances uncertainty quantification approaches, addressing limitations in existing landfill methane estimation models. This innovative framework identifies the most influential parameters, providing a robust foundation for refining predictive models. The decay rate constant (k) was determined to be 0.26 year−1, aligned with the guidelines for humid areas. Notably, the highest standard deviation in methane estimation was observed during the initial post-disposal years, reaching 1,384,751.5 m3 CH4/year using the BMP method and 2,266,762 m3 CH4/year with the simplified method, highlighting how early-stage variability impacts overall methane predictions, emphasizing the critical need for site-specific data. These insights contribute to improved landfill gas management strategies and support decision-making for sustainable waste management practices. Implications: This research underscores the importance of integrating methodologies like stoichiometric analysis, BMP assays, and Bayesian inference to enhance methane generation estimates from landfills. A significant outcome is the recognition of the inherent uncertainty in key parameters, particularly ultimate methane potential and decay rate constant. By employing Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation, we quantified the uncertainty associated with these parameters and analyzed its influence on methane production predictions. The findings reveal that different methodologies yield varying levels of uncertainty, highlighting the necessity for a comprehensive framework that utilizes site-specific data. This approach not only improves the reliability of methane estimates but also informs greenhouse gas management strategies, fostering more effective decision-making in waste management practices. © 2025 Air & Waste Management Association.},

	abstract = {Biomass pyrolysis is a sustainable process for generating biochar from agricultural waste, though it is generally energy-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, the researchers gathered data from published literature on various biomass types and employed ensemble methods (LSBoost) and supervised machine learning (Gaussian process regression) to construct predictive models. The results reveal that both models can predict well, with excellent correlations between expected and actual values. In comparison to the LSBoost model (0.9783 for training and 0.9879 for testing), the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model had higher R values for training (0.9883) and testing (0.9969). Likewise, the R2 values during training (0.9767) and testing (0.9938) were greater in the case of the GPR model than for the LSBoost model (0.9571 for training). Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) revealed that both models captured the data precisely. However, the GPR model outperformed the LSBoost model in both during training as well as model test stages, providing higher (0.9766 for training and 0.9933 for testing) values. The GPR model outperforms the others due to superior correlation, improved variability capture, and lower errors. These findings offer useful insights for sustainable biomass utilization and provide valuable insights for optimizing pyrolysis operations. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is highly detrimental, and its death distribution peculiarity has severely affected people's health and the operations of businesses. COVID-19 has wholly undermined the global economy, including inflicting significant damage to the ever-emerging biomass supply chain; its sustainability is disintegrating due to the coronavirus. The biomass supply chain must be sustainable and robust enough to adapt to the evolving and fluctuating risks of the market due to the coronavirus or any potential future pandemics. However, no such study has been performed so far. To address this issue, investigating how COVID-19 influences a biomass supply chain is vital. This paper presents a dynamic risk assessment methodological framework to model biomass supply chain risks due to COVID-19. Using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) formalism, the impacts of COVID-19 on the performance of biomass supply chain risks have been studied. The proposed model has been applied to the biomass supply chain of a U.S.-based Mahoney Environmental® company in Washington, USA. The case study results show that it would take one year to recover from the maximum damage to the biomass supply chain due to COVID-19, while full recovery would require five years. Results indicate that biomass feedstock gate availability (FGA) is 2%, due to pandemic and lockdown conditions. Due to the availability of vaccination and gradual business reopenings, this availability increases to 92% in the second year. Results also indicate that the price of fossil-based fuel will gradually increase after one year of the pandemic; however, the market prices of fossil-based fuel will not revert to pre-coronavirus conditions even after nine years. K-fold cross-validation is used to validate the DBN. Results of validation indicate a model accuracy of 95%. It is concluded that the pandemic has caused risks to the sustainability of biomass feedstock, and the current study can help develop risk mitigation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Decision-making in fishery management depends on the reliable quantification of uncertainty, which emerges from a variety of sources. For small-scale fisheries (SSF) in developing countries, the main sources of uncertainty are the available data, which are often untrustworthy, and poor institutional controls, which allow illegal fishing activities. Despite the global spread of SSF, the management of these socio-ecological resources is usually based on insufficient assessments estimated using scarce data. In this study, we identify and quantify the uncertainty associated with the harvested biomass of southern king crab (SKC) (Lithodes santolla), as declared by artisanal fishers of the Magallanes Region, Chile, in order to assess the harvestable biomass under a precautionary (conservative) approach to its exploitation in a scarce information context. This analysis includes the application of (i) fuzzy-Bayesian machine learning to quantify the uncertainty related to the harvested biomass per vessel per fishing cruise (C), and (ii) nonlinear polynomial regression models to project the spatial distribution of C according to the estimated uncertainty limits (minimum and maximum). The uncertainty analysis shows a 2000 kg threshold for C; beyond that, the declared harvest does not follow the estimated relationship between biomass and habitat characteristics (temperature, turbidity). The maps created from this analysis convey crucial information that would allow a more rational exploitation of the SKC stock and could be used to estimate a sustainable fishing quota, i.e., allocating effort according to the harvestable biomass. Our results suggest that the proposed tool can reliably inform management faced with uncertainty in stock exploitation by SSF, particularly when information is scarce. © 2018},

	abstract = {Accurate prediction of biochar yield from biomass pyrolysis is essential for optimizing production in sustainable agriculture, yet remains technically challenging due to multiple interacting factors. This study developed a predictive framework using a curated dataset of 211 samples, each including 14 normalized input features (chemical, physical, operational) and one output variable (biochar yield, wt%). Machine learning modeling utilized Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), with hyperparameters exhaustively tuned via Gaussian Processes Optimization (GPO), Evolutionary Strategies (ES), Bayesian Probability Improvement (BPI), and Batch Bayesian Optimization (BBO). Models were evaluated on a train-test split (90% training, 10% testing) and the best performance was achieved by the GBDT–BPI model: total R² = 0.982, mean squared error (MSE) = 1.65, average absolute relative error percentage (AARE%) = 1.35; on the test set, R² = 0.693, MSE = 15.2, AARE% = 9.54. Comparative analysis showed GBDT–BPI outperformed GBDT–GPO (total R² = 0.978; MSE = 2.01; AARE% = 1.72), GBDT–ES (total R² = 0.976; MSE =  2.13; AARE% = 3.81), and GBDT–BBO (total R² = 0.980; MSE = 1.81; AARE% = 2.58). Sensitivity study presented reside duration, temperature, and fixed carbon as the top parameters of yield. Time efficiency was comparable for all optimizers, with BBO taking the longest (313 s/500 iterations). Diagnostic leverage analysis demonstrated high data quality, with less than 1% flagged as influential outliers. This integrated approach delivered high-accuracy, interpretable prediction, and revealed critical parameters for process optimization in biomass pyrolysis workflows. © The Author(s) 2025.

	abstract = {Resource-efficient production of value-added products from lignocellulosic waste is an important requisite for sustainable development. Since constituent separation of lignocellulosic waste is challenging due to the energetically robust structure of the cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin network, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is used for rapid, non-invasive analysis of cellulose and lignin for lignocellulose farm waste procured from about 30 different crops post-harvest. FTIR mode peak heights show linear concentration dependence over a narrow range, and yield 44 ± 5% cellulose and 9.95 ± 2% lignin content in one variety of rice straw, with high standard deviation for inter-species yield. Due to compositional heterogeneity and multivariate nature, FTIR data is analyzed with machine learning models. Species-wide pattern classification for cellulose and lignin in the lignocellulose data is first conducted with linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. For the present data, the best classification accuracy is obtained with random forest algorithm with an accuracy score of 0.75, with least mismatches between the predicted and true values. Convolutional neural network modeling with Bayesian regularization training algorithm using FTIR absorption peak parameters resulted in a good representation of the lignocellulose data with root mean square error ~ 0.11. The structural changes produced in cellulose due to different pre-treatments is analyzed with peak heights of FTIR modes and correlated with efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis to form glucose. Lignocellulose pre-treatment with deep eutectic solvent improves cellulose accessibility to enzymes, with 38% glucose yield enhancement in comparison to acid and alkali pre-treatments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Spawning stock biomass (SSB) is one of the most common measures of stock status. However recent research on reproductive potential has shown that alternative variables may be an improvement over SSB. In the case of European hake (Merluccius merluccius), it is known that large individuals produce more eggs by unit of body weight, and their quality is better than those of small individuals. Under these circumstances, application of reproductive potential may be pertinent in the implementation of the Johannesburg agreement, since it is not only the spawning biomass but also its age or length structure that defines stock productivity and its ability to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). In this contribution we used an age-length structured population model to assess the impact of different reproductive indices (total spawning biomass, female spawning biomass and egg production) on MSY reference points. First, we analyzed how these different indices alter our perception about per recruit productivity. Second, we analyzed the quality of these alternative reproductive indices to explain and predict recruitment using different model structures (Ricker and Beverton-Holt) and Bayesian inference. Third, we combined per recruit models and stochastic stock-recruitment relationships to estimate the probability distributions of MSY biological reference points (MSY, Fmsy, Stockmsy, and Fcrash). Our results show that, for hake stocks where larger fish have a strong contribution to stock reproductive potential, use of alternative reproductive indices will affect estimations of stock sustainability. The change in perception of relative contribution of each length class is exhibited in two opposite ways: reproductive potential per recruit and the shape of the stock-recruitment relationship defined with steepness. In our case, the change from SSB to egg production, resulted in an increase in steepness which counteracted the depletion per recruit resulting in a larger Fmsy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A recently estimated high mesopelagic biomass level, along with the increasing demand for raw material for fish oil and fishmeal, has sparked interest on exploiting mesopelagic populations. However, their exploitation is controversial due to their ecological role as primary prey for other populations and as CO2 sequestrators. Therefore, before starting a new fishery, the three pillars of sustainability, ecological, economic and social, should be assessed. In the Bay of Biscay Maurolicus muelleri is the main mesopelagic species. Based on data collected over an eight-year period, a simulation model was implemented to assess the biological, economic and social performance of different fleets and exploitation levels. The conditioning of the population dynamics model presented several challenges, as the available survey index did not cover the full population distribution every year and the population had never been exploited in the Bay of Biscay. To overcome these problems an absolute population index was estimated using a spatio-temporal model, which was later used to adjust an age structured population dynamics model. Both models were fitted using Bayesian statistics to account for inherent uncertainty. The fishery was conditioned by identifying the most suitable fleet and estimating the initial investment and operational costs. The social pillar was approached through the social cost of carbon. The estimated biomass of M. muelleri in the Bay of Biscay fluctuated around 1.2 million tonnes. When it comes to exploitation, an industrial fishery may generate profits while maintaining a sustainable biomass level under good efficiency conditions. However, it would be challenging to recover the initial investment. Additionally, the estimated added value generated by this fishery would not be able to compensate for public costs associated with the impacts on carbon sequestration. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The stable and sustainable operation of anaerobic digestion (AD1) plants is crucial for their feasible long-term operation. Due to the high non-linearity of the AD process, the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the performance of a robust unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for dynamic process state estimation for the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW2). A traditional UKF performance degrades in case of dynamical model uncertainties or the presence of unknown Gaussian and non-Gaussian noises. The utilized robust UKF proposed by Zhao and Mili (2019) addresses this issue by improving the accuracy of state estimation using the H-infinity filtering theory. The performance of the utilized estimator is tested for the case of uncertainties within the AD model and the substrate feed, as well as unknown Gaussian and non-Gaussian process and measurement noise. Results show that the developed robust UKF estimator achieves higher accuracy and presents higher robustness against uncertainties. Besides, the mathematical model considered for the simulation and the state estimator both rely on the extended version of the AD model No. 2 (E-AM23) including a hydrolysis step. This model is a simplified AD model, which is a suitable choice for control and estimation purposes providing a reasonable trade-off between complexity and accuracy. In this paper, the developed E-AM2 model is adapted for the AD process of OFMSW. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The red octopus (Octopus maya) is an endemic species of the Yucatán Peninsula and its fishery is one of the most important along the Atlantic coast of Mexico. Commercial exploitation started in 1949. Since 2002 an index of abundance has been estimated, and this index was used to perform a stock assessment and decision analysis using the Schaefer model. A Bayesian approach was applied to estimate the model parameters and to project the species population under two management scenarios with a constant harvest rate and a positive implementation error. Results suggest that in 1995 the biomass corresponded to 23% of the population carrying capacity (K) and that the current stock is only 14% of K. The population may be depleted and a rebuilding plan might be necessary. In the decision analysis, when the implementation error was included, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the current level of exploitation (50% harvest rate) could produce a decreasing trend with the most probable biomass of 9679 t and an expected catch of 7920 t in 2018, and an expected probability of 0.82 of the population being less than 40% of K. On the contrary, a 30% harvest rate would raise the expected catch in 2018 (12,058 t), also reducing the probability of the population being smaller than 40% of K. The inclusion of the implementation error provides a more realistic scenario and represents a more conservative option; therefore, using this type of auxiliary data within a Bayesian framework is recommended for the decision making process. If adopted by Mexican fisheries managers, the approach used in this study could help improve the management of this resource and keep exploitation at sustainable levels.},

	abstract = {The neon flying squid (Ommastrephes bartramii) in the Northwest Pacific Ocean is one economically important cephalopod, largely exploited by squid jigging fleets from Chinese Mainland, Japan, and Chinese Taibei. In this study, a Bayesian Bio-economic model was developed using fishery data from Chinese Mainland, Japan, and Chinese Taibei, and relevant fishery economic data from Chinese Mainland. The stock assessment and risk analysis of alternative management strategies for O. bartramii were carried out. Three prior distributions (i.e., uniform, normal and logarithmic normal) for model parameters were assumed in different scenarios. The results showed that the estimated model parameters and reference points such as maximum sustainable yield (MSY), maximum economic yield (MEY), bio-economic balance point (BE) and fishing mortality were similar in the scenarios of normal and logarithmic normal prior assumptions. However, the estimates were larger in the scenario of uniform prior assumption. The fishing mortalities and annual catches from 1996 to 2008 were lower than the reference points F0.1 and MSY in all the three scenarios, indicating that O. bartramii stock is at sustainable exploited level. The results of decision analysis indicated that under the same harvest rate, the catch and biomass in 2023 from the uniform assumption were the highest. However, the highest probability of the collapse was found for squid resources after 2023. Our findings suggested that the harvest rate of 0.4 appeared to be the best management regulation under the uniform assumption, and the MSY would be 200 thousand tons. In addition, the harvest rate of 0.5 would be the best management regulation under the other two assumptions, and the MSY would be 180 thousand tons, which balanced the desire for high yields and the healthy population. The results of this study could be used to provide management suggestions for neon flying squid in the Northwest Pacific Ocean. © 2019},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, populations of rockfish Sebastes spp. off the U.S. West Coast have declined sharply, leading to heightened concern about the sustainability of current harvest policies for these populations. In this paper, I develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to jointly estimate the stock−recruit relationships of rockfish stocks in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Stock−recruit curves for individual stocks are linked using a prior distribution for the “steepness” parameter of the Beverton–Holt stock−recruit curve, defined as the expected recruitment at 20% of unfished biomass relative to unfished recruitment. The choice of a spawning biomass per recruit (SPR) harvest rate is considered a problem in decision theory, in which different options are evaluated in the presence of uncertainty in the stock−recruit relationship. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to obtain the marginal distributions of variables of interest to management, such as the yield at a given SPR rate. A wide range of expected yield curves were obtained for different rockfish stocks. The stocks of Pacific ocean perch S. alutus in the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands are apparently the most resilient, with maximum sustainable yield (MSY) harvest rates greater than F 30% (the fishing mortality rate that reduces SPR to 30% of its unfished value) for all model configurations. In contrast, the MSY harvest rate for the West Coast stock of Pacific ocean perch was lower than F 70%. The SPR rates at MSY for other stocks were clustered between F 40% and F 60% and depended on both the stock−recruit model (Beverton–Holt or Ricker) and the model for recruitment variability (lognormal or gamma). Meta-analysis results should be interpreted cautiously due to autocorrelation in the model residuals for several stocks and the potential confounding effect of decadal variation in ecosystem productivity. An F 40% harvest rate, the current default harvest rate for rockfish, exceeded the estimated F MSY rate for all West Coast rockfish stocks with the exception of black rockfish S. melanops. A harvest rate of F 50% is suggested as a risk-neutral F MSY proxy for rockfish. A more risk-averse alternative would be to apply an SPR harvest rate in the F 55%−F 60% range. © 2002 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {This study develops a state-space modeling and Bayesian approach to a biomass dynamic model of green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in British Columbia, Canada. The objective is to determine limit and target reference points for harvest quota options for this fishery, and to assess the degree of risk associated with these target reference points (in which risk is defined as the probability that the target reference point will include the limit reference point when all uncertainties are considered). These uncertainties include random variability both in catch per unit effort and in annual biomass dynamics, and uncertainties in catch and effort data in the developing years of this fishery. In addition, the approach uses fishery-independent survey data as auxiliary information to index green urchin population abundance. Compared with the traditional methods of fitting the biomass dynamic model, this new approach incorporates more realistic error structures. The resulting probability distribution for the limit reference point (maximum sustainable yield, MSY) is likely to reflect the true uncertainties about MSY more closely, and can be used to measure the risk of exceeding MSY for setting fishing quotas for this green urchin stock. It is concluded that the current practice of selecting target reference points for this population at 25-50% of MSY has a probability of including the limit reference point (MSY) of <2.5%.},

	abstract = {Biological drinking water treatment technologies offer a cost-effective and sustainable approach to mitigate microcystin (MC) toxins from harmful algal blooms. To effectively engineer these systems, an improved predictive understanding of the bacteria degrading these toxins is required. This study reports an initial comparison of several unstructured kinetic models to describe MC microbial metabolism by isolated degrading populations. Experimental data was acquired from the literature describing both MC removal and cell growth kinetics when MC was utilized as the primary carbon and energy source. A novel model-data calibration approach melding global single-objective, multi-objective, and Bayesian optimization in addition to a fully Bayesian approach to model selection and hypothesis testing were applied to identify and compare parameter and predictive uncertainties associated with each model structure. The results indicated that models incorporating mechanisms of enzyme-MC saturation, affinity, and cooperative binding interactions of a theoretical single, rate limiting reaction accurately and reliably predicted MC degradation and bacterial growth kinetics. Diverse growth characteristics were observed among MC degraders, including moderate to high maximum specific growth rates, very low to substantial affinities for MC, high yield of new biomass, and varying degrees of cooperative enzyme-MC binding. Model predictions suggest that low specific growth rates and MC removal rates of degraders are expected in practice, as MC concentrations in the environment are well below saturating levels for optimal growth. Overall, this study represents an initial step towards the development of a practical and comprehensive kinetic model to describe MC biodegradation in the environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Torrefied biomass is a vital green energy source with applications in circular economies, addressing agricultural residue and rising energy demands. In this study, ML models were used to predict durability (%) and mass loss (%). Firstly, data was collected and preprocessed, and its distribution and correlation were analyzed. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Ensemble Learning Trees (ELT) were then trained and tested on 80 % and 20 % of the data, respectively. Both machine learning models underwent optimization through Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. GPR-PSO demonstrates excellent accuracy in predicting durability (%), achieving a training R2 score of 0.9469 and an RMSE value of 0.0785. GPR-GA exhibits exceptional performance in predicting mass loss (%), achieving a training R2 value of 1 and an RMSE value of 9.7373e-05. The temperature and duration during torrefaction are crucial variables that are in line with the conclusions drawn from previous studies. GPR and ELT models effectively predict and optimize torrefied biomass quality, leading to enhanced energy density, mechanical properties, grindability, and storage stability. Additionally, they contribute to sustainable agriculture by reducing carbon emissions, improving cost-effectiveness, and aiding in the design and development of pelletizers. This optimization not only increases energy density and grindability but also enhances nutrient delivery efficiency, water retention, and reduces the carbon footprint. Consequently, these outcomes support biodiversity and promote sustainable agricultural, ecosystem, and environmental practices. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Efficient and sustainable use of biomass resources is crucial to meet the increasing demand for bio-based products and renewable energy. The biomass supply chain, which includes harvesting, collecting, logistics, storage, and pre-treatment, faces challenges due to uncertainties such as market fluctuations, equipment availability, weather conditions, and transportation constraints. These uncertainties often hinder the optimisation of the supply chain. This research work explores the performance of the biomass supply chain by optimizing operations while accounting for these uncertainties. Nigeria is faced with power issues and there are resources to combat the problem through generation of cleaner energy from biomass. Using mathematical modelling, the study evaluates the impact of uncertainty on key performance areas like feedstock supply, inventory management, transportation efficiency, and processing capacity. The research demonstrates the importance of incorporating uncertainty-aware solutions to minimize risks and improve the flexibility of the biomass supply chain. Sensitivity analyses and case studies shows that the proposed probabilistic modelling approach provides valuable insights into system vulnerabilities and effective strategies for optimizing operations under uncertain conditions. The findings highlight the potential of this approach to improve decision making, resource allocation, and promote sustainable practices in the biomass sector. Ultimately, the study contributes to advancing biomass supply chain management, paving the way for a more resilient and efficient use of bioresources. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The generic and simple version of SALUS (System Approach to Land Use Sustainability) crop model was recently integrated in the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) cropping system model to provide an alternative approach to more complex crop models without the need for a detailed parameterization. A previous uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the model (SALUS-Simple) established that accurate estimation of 15 of the 20 crop parameters required for predicting crop performance under water limitation was necessary to achieve reliable simulations. The present study used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian stepwise approach for estimating crop parameters in SALUS-Simple using limited, end-of-season data (limited data case) and detailed in-season data (detailed data case). Independent testing were performed using data distributed with DSSAT version 4.5.Results of the detailed data case indicated that the estimated parameters resulted in smaller deviations between simulated and measured variables and in posterior parameter distributions with smaller variances. Independent testing showed that maize growth simulations (based on both data cases) were in good agreement with observations while peanut and cotton growth was simulated with mixed success. SALUS-Simple predictions using parameters estimated in the limited data case were concordant with observations for end-of-season biomass and yield, but simulations of in-season growth were degraded relative to the use of parameters estimated in the detailed data case. We conclude that the use of a sequential approach reduced compensation errors and, the use of a range of data types combined with a higher ratio between the number of data points and the number of estimated parameters significantly reduced uncertainties associated with the estimated parameters. Furthermore, model predictions based on mean parameter values can be regarded as reliable estimators of the expected values of the distributions of model predictions when an average prediction rather than a distribution is needed. Results from this study highlighted the principle that parameters estimated based on end-of-season data do not guarantee accurate prediction of in-season growth even if a Bayesian approach is used. The ability of the SALUS-Simple model to be parameterized or adapted for simulating canopy-level potential production of annual plants based on limited data is promising. Further testing of the model will help establish its response to different soils, climates and crops. © 2014.},
