	abstract = {The shipping industry remains a vital cog in the global trade but contributes approximately 3 % of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making it a key target for decarbonization. This study examines the challenges and opportunities in transitioning Sri Lanka's shipping sector toward carbon-neutral practices, leveraging its position as a strategic maritime hub in South Asia. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research explores the feasibility of alternative fuels such as H2, nuclear energy, NH3, CH3OH, liquid Natural Gas (LNG), and biofuels, alongside renewable energy integration and emission monitoring systems in port operations. Findings highlight significant barriers, including technological limitations, policy gaps, financial constraints, and insufficient stakeholder collaboration. Despite these challenges, the study proposes actionable solutions, including policy reforms, investments in low-emission technologies, and enhanced international partnerships. A 15-year roadmap aligns Sri Lanka's maritime operations with global climate goals, offering practical strategies like financial incentives and regulatory alignment. The study supports United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), SDG 13 (Climate Action), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). These findings provide a valuable blueprint for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers, paving the way for sustainable transformation in Sri Lanka's maritime sector and offering insights applicable to other developing nations. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Evolutionary game theory (EGT) has unique advantages in analyzing the spontaneous formation of social habits, norms, institutions or systems and their influencing factors. In the electricity bidding market, power generation companies and grid enterprises encounter increasingly complex multi-subject optimization decision-making challenges that cannot be comprehensively handled by conventional optimization methods due to their reliance on centralized objectives, perfect information, and fully rational participants. This survey focuses on long-term strategic bidding strategies, which involve sustained decision-making processes over extended periods to optimize cumulative profits and market positions. Moreover, classical game models assume complete rationality, thus failing to capture the iterative and adaptive decision-making behaviors prevalent in modern power markets. However, the long-term market bidding process involving groups of generators in the power generation-side market (PGM) under asymmetric information conditions is a complex process of long-term dynamic evolution. To contextualize these complexities, we incorporate a comparative survey illustrating the main methods, assumptions, and knowledge gaps in existing research, ensuring a clear understanding of why evolutionary game-theoretic approaches can more thoroughly capture the dynamic, bounded-rational nature of bidding. This paper reviews in detail the research on the application of EGT to multi-group bidding games in PGMs. First, the basic structure and development history of EGT are briefly introduced, and the essential differences between EGT and classical game theory (CGT) in terms of modeling are compared from several aspects, based on which several core concepts of EGT are further elaborated. Then, the relevant theories of electricity market (EM) are described, especially for the PGM, the definition and characteristics of EM are described, and the typical PGM transaction model and market bidding mechanism are summarized. Following that, this paper reviews and analyzes the current status of research on bidding strategies in PGMs from four aspects, including cost analysis of generators, electricity price forecasting, bidding behavior, and bidding decision support systems. On this basis, this paper reviews the research on the application of game theory, especially EGT, to long-term strategic bidding in PGM. In this paper, we also present a comparative case study between CGT and EGT to demonstrate how EGT better accounts for bounded rationality and dynamic strategy adaptation. Through our comparative case study, we show that EGT more accurately reflects real-world complexities, producing more robust and adaptive bidding outcomes than CGT. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary and outlook, aiming to provide new insights and practical guidance for power producers to formulate effective long-term bidding strategies in actual electricity market scenarios. Overall, our work is of pivotal importance because it provides a more realistic and robust framework—evolutionary game theory—that captures the dynamic, distributed, and uncertain nature of real-world bidding. This approach not only fills a gap in existing theories but also offers actionable insights for grid operators and policymakers seeking more efficient and equitable market outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The global supply chain has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its intricate nature and operational challenges. Companies face the crucial task of integrating various components to maintain competitiveness and enhance overall performance across the supply chain. Achieving this goal necessitates vertical integration to ensure coherence and coordination among decision-making processes at different temporal and spatial scales, bridging the gap between strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. This article proposes a mathematical model that integrates the three previous decisions within the supply chain context, aiming to maintain coherence while considering economic and environmental objectives (few papers cover this challenge). By addressing the complexities of multi-scale modeling and optimization, the model seeks to provide a holistic view of supply chain operations. The model focuses on the transport decisions at the operational level, resulting in the coupling between a strategic and tactical model and a vehicle routing problem. Nonetheless, achieving this integration effectively from a modeling and resolution point of view leads to computational and methodological challenges due to the multi-scale, multi-site, and multi-objective nature of the problem, requiring an innovative approach for effective model resolution. The contributions of this article pave the way towards more sustainable and efficient supply chain operations. The model capabilities are exemplified through the real case study of the bioethanol supply chain in Ethiopia. For the location of the different firms of the supply chain, the country is divided into 58 zones (second level administrative subdivision in Ethiopia) to have a precise mapping of the area. The result of the case study shows that in adding the operational level decisions to the strategic-tactical ones has not only changed the topology of the network configurations but has greatly affected the economic and environmental criteria due to more precise estimation of all activities. The results put also in highlight that there is a compromise to find between both previous objectives by identifying Pareto alternative scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Most research in the field of designing and planning bioethanol supply chains has been based on deterministic models, which do not consider dynamic environmental conditions and thus do not provide reliable outputs. Classic robust models did not have this weakness, but due to their excessive conservatism, they increased supply chain costs, making them unattractive to investors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and optimize the biomass-to-bioethanol supply chain network using data-driven robust optimization methods and disjunctive uncertainty sets. Methodology: The methodology of this study is a multi-methodology approach based on mathematical modeling and machine learning algorithms. Initially, uncertainty sets for the non-deterministic model parameter were created using K-means and SVC methods. Then, a data-driven optimization model was designed to optimize the biomass-to-bioethanol supply chain network, addressing the issues of previous classic approaches. Findings: The findings of this study are presented in two categories: strategic and operational decisions. The strategic section focuses on determining the optimal locations for biomass cultivation, preprocessing centers, and refineries. In the operational section, the optimal amounts of biomass sent to preprocessing centers and refineries were determined. Originality/Value: This study, by producing robust solutions without the conservatism of traditional robust optimization approaches, can significantly attract public and private sector investors. Additionally, using a three-objective model based on a sustainable development approach that simultaneously considers economic, social, and environmental components, enhances the comprehensiveness of this research, providing more realistic and detailed results. © 2024, Research Expansion Alliance (REA).

	abstract = {Steel is the most common industrial material worldwide due to its numerous applications, high strength and recyclability. Steel production involves alloying iron with various amounts of carbon and other elements to produce thousands of different grades and types of steel for various purposes. However, the intensive use of carbon in steel production is one of the factors contributing to global climate change. To use of hydrogen and renewable energy sources in steel production has emerged as a significant solution to reduce carbon emissions. The aim of this study is to obtain green hydrogen for the production of green steel. The focus is on utilizing offshore wind energy as a renewable energy source to give us the energy we need to electrolyze seawater. The study uses the seas of Turkiye for case analysis. In this paper, an integrated Multi-criteria decision-making method is used to integrate hybrid energy systems and their application for green industry and to select a location for a power generation plant. The study is a new contribution to the literature in terms of its scope. Green steel's location selection is addressed for the first time in the literature. The weights of the criteria are determined by employing the Best-Worst Method (BWM) as a multi-criteria decision-making technique, and the alternatives are evaluated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). By using the BWM method, decision makers can have a clear understanding of the evaluation range for pairwise comparisons of criteria, which reduces potential biases. According to the study, the northern part of the Aegean Sea in Turkiye is the most suitable alternative for green steel production, with offshore wind energy being used for hydrogen production. The study also revealed that the most important main criterion for this hybrid system is “natural factors”, and the sub-criteria are “wind speed and power density” by far compared to other sub-criteria. The fact that the area determined for the facility is suitable for construction and the possibility that the customer of the energy produced is other industrial establishments here is the most important indicator that the methods applied give good results. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy plays a growing role in the present energy market and attracts more attention in scientific researches and commercial application. Hydrogen energy has an increasing attractive in energy market due to its high energy density, pollution-free utilization usage and wide availability. Current challenge which obstructs large-scale application is safe and reliable hydrogen storage, which requires finding promising materials to promote hydrogen energy. Therefore, we have predicted three potential lithium-transition metal-based hydrides LiTM3LiH8 (TM = Sc, Ti V) for hydrogen storage based on first principles calculation. The stability analysis based on formation energy, elastic constants and phonon spectra confirms all hydrides are stable and feasible in practical application. Besides, they have a increasing ductility in the order of Sc, Ti and V. Among all studied materials, LiV3LiH8 has the best mechanical characteristics due to its excellent ductility and high Young's modulus (123.19 GPa), which are beneficial for resistance to adverse external surroundings. The electronic properties suggest that all hydrides metallic in band structures. Meanwhile, we analyzed how hydrogen was storage and the binding information from multiple perspectives, including the charge analysis, DOS, ELF and COHP. From multiple analyses of bond strengths, except the strong binding from transition metal, the centered Li atom is verified to possess greater influence than corner Li atom, which makes a viable regulation of hydrogen properties by substituting centered alkali metal atom in future. As concluded in this study, LiTi3LiH8 has a high storage capacity of 4.83 wt% along with a desorption temperature of 305.5 K, which is considered as a promising hydrogen storage material. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Older buildings often exhibit multiple problems, such as high energy consumption, high carbon emissions, and outdated performance. To achieve optimal decision-making for the energy efficiency retrofitting of existing buildings, a data fusion-based hybrid multicriteria decision-making method based on an extension-based trapezoidal cloud model (TCM), and a multidimensional renovation program evaluation index system including technical, safety, economic, and environmental applicability is proposed. The validity and applicability of the model is verified using an old building renovation as an example. The results indicate that (1) incorporating technical, safety, economic, and environmental suitability factors will enable future of building retrofitting to focus on sustainability. None of the current retrofit programs can economically cover the costs they incur through their energy saving benefits, which will not motivate owners to complete retrofitting and requires joint efforts between the government and the building industry to improve the sustainability of existing buildings. (2) Building retrofitting programs should primarily prioritize technical and economic applicability, which exhibit importance values of 0.2930 and 0.2496, respectively. (3) The stability of the retrofit effect is the primary reason for variations in the effectiveness of selected programs. A program with a greater degree of affiliation with levels I, II, and III of the index is more stable and less prone to deterioration than other programs. The proposed method provides an efficient decision-making tool for the selection of retrofit programs for existing buildings and is suitable for popularization and application, thus promoting building energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Coordinating investments in charging resources and generation resources can enhance social benefits while ensuring the charging needs of EVs are met. This study aims to optimize the long-term investment strategies for these resources using a heuristic algorithm-informed system dynamic (SD) approach. Firstly, a SD model is developed to simulate the long-term interactions among generation resources, EVs, and power demand, capturing their dynamic relationships. Then, the fixed feedback functions of investment parameters in the SD model are replaced with an optimization model, enabling parameter optimization for environmental and economic objectives. Given that the process must quantify the aforementioned long-term interrelationships with potential high-order, nonlinear feedback loops, the solution is implemented using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Data from a specific province in China was used for the case study. The results show that the optimized investment portfolio reduced carbon costs and total investment by 2.4% and 22%, respectively, while total social costs decreased by 17% compared to the pre-set investment strategy.

This is a novel study that seeks to take advantage of the renewable energy potential available on the islands themselves. Finally, after analyzing the results, it is concluded that the energy mix for 2050 can consider 49.12 % wind power and 38.59 % solar photovoltaic, as well as in smaller proportions 7.02 % biomass and 5.26 % biofuels, thereby achieving 100 % of renewable energy in the grouped islands thanks to their energy potential. Decision makers may consider this study a reference before committing resources and carrying out modern energy planning. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study addresses the challenge of enhancing viability of an interconnected supply chain network, particularly in the context of low-probability high-impact events that recur unpredictably. We re-examine the viability from the views of agility, resilience, and sustainability, and propose a novel hybrid approach which integrates dynamic network data and multi-echelon interaction. Diverging from traditional static approaches, we introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that strategically maintains long-term survival by coordination between timely response actions and the risk of overreaction. A data-driven hidden Markov model is built to update the risk forecasting via dynamic network data. A Bayesian network game theoretical model is developed to support collaborative risk mitigating via the multi-echelon interaction. The main findings are as follows. In the short term, we encourage enterprises to engage in collaborative risk mitigating to significantly increase the likelihood of reaching a consensus on achieving a more cost-efficient level of risk mitigation, marked by an intriguing interplay between weakened individual fairness and the tendency to mitigate network-wide risk more economically. In the long term, we advocate building a data-driven, structure-dynamic, and interaction-focused risk response timing system to enable the network to adapt to changes swiftly and achieve desired viable levels efficiently. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

Most existing studies focus on mathematical modeling and algorithm solving for multi-objective models aimed at minimizing cost or pollution. They lack consideration for the resilience of decision solutions in the face of uncertain and unpredictable disruptive incidents. This paper aims to bridge the research gap by proposing a top-down hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model that incorporates cost, pollution, social discontent, and system resilience simultaneously. The proposed model integrates various methods such as integer programming modeling, simulation modeling, and catastrophe analysis. It addresses the challenge that disruptive incidents cannot be precisely expressed. Additionally, it quantitatively analyzes the factors that impact system resilience. Finally, the proposed model is validated by applying it to a waste management network based on the real case of Shenzhen city. The results demonstrate notable differences in the resilience indexes among the solutions in the Pareto-optimal set, which confirms the significance of system resilience from another aspect. Further catastrophe analysis reveals several valuable insights for urban waste management. This paper offers a new perspective to cope with various risks related to waste management and provides a method reference and decision support for the construction of urban resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes an optimal scheduling framework by integrating the response surface methodology with mixed-integer nonlinear programming. Explicit formulas describing the Habor–Bosch process are provided in response surface models, which are simple, exhibit high fidelity, and help ensure optimal performance. In the optimization process, capacity is allocated based on the supply and utilization of renewable power, electricity, and hydrogen. This framework departs from traditional single-load production models, effectively minimizing curtailment and addressing the intermittency of renewable energy sources. The results show that multi-load operations achieve a favorable balance between economic benefits (profit of 33.8 million CNY·y−1) and renewable energy utilization efficiency (0.4 % curtailment). The industrial case studies considered herein validate the feasibility of PtA systems and support the development of other power-to-X systems. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Integrating innovation and environmental responsibility has become important in pursuing sustainable industrial practices in the contemporary world. These twin imperatives have stimulated research into developing methods that optimize industrial processes, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness while mitigating undesirable ecological impacts. This objective is exemplified by the emergence of biochar derived from the thermo-chemical transformation of biomass. This review examines biochar production methods and their potential applications across various aspects of the iron and steel industries (ISI). The technical, economic, and sustainable implications of integrating biochar into the ISI were explored. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization are the most efficient methods for higher biochar yield (25–90%). Biochar has several advantages- higher heating value (30–32 MJ/kg), more porosity (58.22%), and significantly larger surface area (113 m2/g) compared to coal and coke. However, the presence of biochar often reduces fluidity in a coal-biochar mixture. The findings highlighted that biochar production and implementation in ISI often come with higher costs, primarily due to the higher expense of substitute fuels compared to traditional fossil fuels. The economic viability and societal desirability of biochar are highly uncertain and vary significantly based on factors such as location, feedstock type, production scale, and biochar pricing, among others. Furthermore, biomass and biochar supply chain is another important factor which determines its large scale implementation. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities to reduce emissions from BF-BOF operations by utilizing biochar technologies. Overall, the present study explored integrating diverse biochar production methods into the ISI aiming to contribute to the ongoing research on sustainable manufacturing practices, underscoring their significance in shaping a more environmentally conscious future. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Biomass, a renewable resource crucial for carbon neutrality, serves as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels by closing the carbon loop. The biotransformation of biomass into carbon–neutral fuels for bioenergy and bioelectricity plays a key role in addressing climate change. Recent advancements in biomass bioenergy management, carbon capture, and carbon-negative emission technologies have been pivotal in reducing atmospheric CO2. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has markedly enhanced these traditional models by optimizing the biomass supply chain, selecting optimal feedstocks, and refining the operation of bioenergy plants.

	abstract = {Replacing fossil technologies with renewable carbon-based technologies is of vital importance for the development of sustainable chemical processes in the future. However, impacts beyond climate change should be carefully evaluated to ensure that this transition to defossilized chemicals is truly sustainable. Here, we develop a framework for sustainable process design that explicitly accounts for the performance attained in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is computed using standard life cycle assessment (LCA) metrics alongside the planetary boundaries (PBs) concept. We apply this approach to design a CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process, where economic and SDGs-based performance are the objectives optimized. We show that the environmentally optimal design reduces the impact on SDG 13 (climate action) substantially relative to the business-as-usual (BAU) fossil counterpart, yet this is done at the expense of worsening other categories. A prospective LCA reveals that such collateral damage will be drastically reduced in the future due to improvements in a range of economic sectors. Overall, this work highlights the need to embrace impacts beyond climate change in process design and the advantages of using hybrid surrogates to expedite the computation of Pareto designs. © 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {The global market demand for natural astaxanthin (AXT) is growing rapidly owing to its potential human health benefits and diverse industry applications, driven by its safety, unique structure, and special function. Currently, the alga Haematococcus pluvialis (alternative name H. lacustris) has been considered as one of the best large-scale producers of natural AXT. However, the industry's further development faces two main challenges: the limited cultivation areas due to light-dependent AXT accumulation and the low AXT yield coupled with high production costs resulting from complex, time-consuming upstream biomass culture and downstream AXT extraction processes. Therefore, it is urgently to develop novel strategies to improve the AXT production in H. pluvialis to meet industrial demands, which makes its commercialization cost-effective. Although several strategies related to screening excellent target strains, optimizing culture condition for high biomass yield, elucidating the AXT biosynthetic pathway, and exploiting effective inducers for high AXT content have been applied to enhance the AXT production in H. pluvialis, there are still some unsolved and easily ignored perspectives. In this review, firstly, we summarize the structure and function of natural AXT focus on those from the algal H. pluvialis. Secondly, the latest findings regarding the AXT biosynthetic pathway including spatiotemporal specificity, transport, esterification, and storage are updated. Thirdly, we systematically assess enhancement strategies on AXT yield. Fourthly, the regulation mechanisms of AXT accumulation under various stresses are discussed. Finally, the integrated and systematic solutions for improving AXT production are proposed. This review not only fills the existing gap about the AXT accumulation, but also points the way forward for AXT production in H. pluvialis. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent decades, the student population in dormitories has increased notably, primarily attributed to the growing number of international students. Dormitories serve as pivotal environments for student development. The coordination and compatibility among students can significantly influence their overall success. This study aims to introduce an innovative method for roommate selection and room allocation within dormitory settings. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, initially, using multi-attribute decision-making methods including the Bayesian best-worst method and weighted aggregated sum product assessment, the incompatibility rate among pairs of students is calculated. Subsequently, using a linear mathematical model, roommates are selected and allocated to dormitory rooms pursuing the twin objectives of minimizing the total incompatibility rate and costs. Finally, the grasshopper optimization algorithm is applied to solve large-sized instances. Findings: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to two common alternatives, i.e. random allocation and preference-based allocation. Moreover, the proposed method’s applicability extends beyond its current context, making it suitable for addressing various matching problems, including crew pairing and classmate pairing. Originality/value: This novel method for roommate selection and room allocation enhances decision-making for optimal dormitory arrangements. Inspired by a real-world problem faced by the authors, this study strives to offer a robust solution to this problem. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Voltage instability is a major problem facing power utility companies due to a lack of maintenance and financial support to maintain the existing power system networks (PSN). Lack of maintenance occurs when PS fails to replace the aging equipment and services and upgrades existing networks. Also, the lack of financial support occurs when there is insufficient financial capital to carry out the above maintenance activities, which has incurred greater power loss in the systems. There is a need to eliminate the loss incurred in the system to avoid voltage collapse. The best way to increase the lifespan of a PSN and improve voltage stability is the optimum allocation of distributed generation (DG). The most common DG are solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines. This review discusses the economic, environmental, and technical benefits of non-traditional DG technologies over a traditional system. However, this work reviewed different DG technologies that can be incorporated into PSN for better loss reduction. Detailed descriptions of energy loss, power loss, and multi-objectives for optimal DG planning were also discussed, along with comprehensive methods used in the sizing and placement of DG for voltage profile improvement (VPI). The findings recommend that the hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm be used for DG placement has it significantly improves voltage profile and lowers power loss. The present study concluded that with proper DG placement, the advantage of DG can be maximally accomplished, the voltage profile is improved, and losses are minimized. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays, energy and power companies compete to get the raw materials and equipment they need on time, as project times lengthen, costs spiral, stock-out continues to plague plans to a decarbonized energy future. The risks reflect the impact of uncertainty and volatility on the resilience of the supply chains. Therefore, there is a need for the enhancement of the production planning in Energy Supply Chains (ESCs), as it enables affordable energy supplies and supports the companies transition to a clean, secure and sustainable energy mix. This study aims to understand the interactive behavior among individuals and optimize their production planning under uncertainty scenarios. In particular, we propose a novel framework to couple an Agent-based Modelling (ABM) and a Co-evolutionary Algorithm (CEA), to realize its capacity to solve a Many-objective Optimization Problem (MaOP) where the profits of multiple agents are concurrently maximized in their interactive transaction processes under normal conditions and uncertain disruption events. For demonstration, we illustrate the proposed approach by considering a five-layer oil and gas ESC model, where uncertainties from multiple sources and the structural dynamics challenge the balance between supply and demand. The results obtained by an integration of a Cooperative Co-evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimizer (CCPSO) algorithm into ABM show the pricing and orders of the target agents are optimized while the loss of ESC resilience is minimized under uncertainty scenarios, proving its capacity of improving the diversity and the convergence, compared to the classic evolutionary algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The rising electricity demand, driven by technological progress and population growth, has made the design of the electricity supply chain a major challenge. The transition to renewable energy sources has led to a substantial reduction in the costs and greenhouse gases emissions of electricity production. This study proposes a hybrid approach consisting of a recurrent neural network and an optimization model for designing a resilient electricity supply chain based on wind and solar energies. First, the electricity demand is forecast using the long short-term memory algorithm. Second, based on the forecast demand, a two-stage stochastic programming model is developed for designing an electricity supply chain under disruption risks. Partial and complete disruptions in power lines and facilities, including power plants, distribution and subtransmission substations, and low-power solar panel farms are considered. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the total cost of the supply chain by making optimal decisions on facility location; technology selection for power plants; setting up transmission lines; and the quantity of power generation, power transmission, and power shortage in low- and high-voltage energy consumption systems. Three strategies are adopted to enhance the supply chain's resilience: multiple renewable energy sources, multiple power transmission lines, and lateral power lines. Lastly, the Sistan and Baluchestan Electric Power Distribution Company in Iran is used as a case study for this work to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, analyze the findings, and derive relevant managerial insights. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The long-term planning and optimisation of renewable and sustainable energy systems is indispensable for the efficient allocation of finite resources, especially in the context of the growing deployment of localised and distributed energy generation systems. These integrated resource planning endeavours primarily aim to minimise total discounted system costs while adhering to a network of interconnected technical constraints, encompassing considerations of reliability, resilience, and the integration of renewable energy sources. In this intricate landscape, the interdependence of optimisation variables that underlie sustainable energy system planning and optimisation processes underscores the critical role of advanced computational models, notably optimisation algorithms and forecasting techniques, as well as innovative business models tailored to renewable energy in the context of diverse distributed energy options. Nevertheless, despite the well-documented drivers that promote the adoption of renewable energy, an array of social, technical, economic, and regulatory barriers poses significant impediments to the realisation of optimally sized and operated renewable and sustainable energy systems. Consequently, a notable disjunction exists between the pace of advancements in enhancing the efficiency and utilisation of such systems and their practical implementation in decentralised energy initiatives. In this context, the paper undertakes a systematic and comprehensive review, synthesising existing empirical evidence concerning the long-term procurement of renewable energy resources with differing optimisation objectives and within the framework of diverse constraints. To shed light on potential strategies for mitigating the so-called “simulation-to-reality gaps” in the development of sustainable energy systems, the paper endeavours to correlate key trends in the design of renewable energy networks with critical socio-techno-economic and regulatory barriers. The review culminates in the formulation of specific recommendations aimed at surmounting these associated barriers, leveraging the pivotal drivers that bolster clean energy production and utilisation. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {Water, land, energy, and agricultural waste are essential resources for agriculture that require systematic allocation to achieve efficient utilization and support the objectives of “carbon peak and neutrality”. In this study, a novel optimization model framework was proposed to manage the water-energy-food nexus (WEFN). In this framework, the system scope is determined and the mass and energy flows within the system are analyzed. Based on bi-level multi-objective programming (BMP), the optimization model aims to reduce risk and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, ensure food security, and promote economic growth, coupled with the uncertainty method including, fuzzy numbers and stochastic numbers, as well as fuzzy possibility entropy. Therefore, the framework is capable of: (1) generating sustainable cross-sectoral WEFN management strategies and proper agricultural waste disposal modes; (2) measuring the optimization-based agricultural GHG emission reduction potential in agricultural cropping-livestock system; (3) dealing with the leader-follower relationships, varying decision-making preferences, and multiple uncertainties in agricultural system. The proposed framework was applied to Wuwei, Northwest China, generating agricultural scale adjustments, water allocation, and agricultural waste disposal schemes in different hydrological years. The results showed that agriculture in Wuwei remains a carbon source after optimization: plant sequestration is the only carbon sink of 82.3–107.4 × 108 kg CO2-eq, and the total carbon emissions are 155.4–165.3 × 108 kg CO2-eq, of which animal husbandry accounts for 54.8 %. All crop straw and 91.6 % of livestock manure are recycled into feed and organic fertilizer, respectively, leading to a total carbon emission reduction of 96.3 × 108 kg CO2-eq. The system performances have been improved in all aspects compared to the status quo, confirming the effectiveness and superiority of the framework. The proposed framework can coordinate agricultural resources from a more holistic perspective, provides a practical basis for sustainable agricultural development, and can be applied to other regions for sustainable agricultural management. © 2024},

	abstract = {Efficiency and profitability are the main drivers of globalization and have led to long and complex supply chains. Recent disturbances such as COVID-19 or the Suez Canal obstruction caused severe supply disruptions and thereby unveiled the vulnerability of global trade. Resilient supply chains are characterized by the capacity to absorb, adapt to, and restore after disruptions. Building upon the established concept of the ‘resilience curve’, this article explores the interplay between resilience capacities, metrics, and actions in the state-of-the-art literature. We first analyze and harmonize the terminology used to describe capacities as well as metrics for quantifying resilience. This results in a set of 17 resilience metrics that describe all characteristics of the resilience curve and can be used as a tool to assess the resilience of a supply chain. Subsequently, we propose how these metrics can be applied to quantify the effect of resilience actions. Finally, we analyze which actions are proposed in the literature and classify those actions according to their relation to traditional supply chain planning tasks. Practitioners such as supply chain decision-makers can implement these actions to strengthen the absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities and are provided with mathematical formulations to quantify the strengthening effect of actions. Academic research can, inter alia, integrate the metrics into multi-criteria optimization models for decision-making and explore the interplay between economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and resilience. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In arid and semi-arid regions, accurate estimates of global primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are critical for understanding and managing water and carbon cycling in these fragile ecosystems. In this study, an improved ET-photosynthesis model (PT-JPL-GPP) was used to optimize GPP and ET estimates in these ecosystems by introducing the near infrared reflectance index (NIRv). NIRv, an indicator of the light use efficiency of vegetation, was integrated into the PT-JPL model. Compared to the original PT-JPL and existing remote sensing models, this PT-JPL-GPP model displayed a higher correlation (R2 = 0.73) and lower BIAS (−19.57 %) for GPP estimation. ET estimates were also noticeably improved, the R2 increased by 0.03(SN-Dhr) to 0.16(US-SRC), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduced by 0.57 mm/month (SN-Dhr) to 4.64 mm/month (US-SRC). Particularly at the GRA site, the R2 was increased from 0.63 to 0.74, and the RMSE and bias was decreased by 1.25 mm/month and 10.51 %, respectively. The PT-JPL-GPP model was comparable with GLEAM, VPM, MOD17, MOD16, and PML-V2 models. The PT-JPL-GPP model exhibits a lower root mean square error and higher correlation for estimating GPP, compared to the VPM, MOD17, and PML-V2 models. The PT-JPL-GPP model outperformed PT-JPL, MOD16 models for estimating ET, but was slightly poorer than GLEAM and PML-V2 models. Our results highlight the merits of NIRv for improving GPP and ET estimates. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a real-world metaheuristic application designed to minimize the simulation errors of a novel one-dimensional (1D) numerical model of a rotary cement kiln, calibrated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. This model aims to significantly reduce simulation time, facilitating the analysis of multiple scenarios. A major challenge is the high proportion of invalid or infeasible solutions typical in industrial environments, compounded by the time-sensitive nature of real-world applications. Another notable difficulty lies in selecting among the plethora of metaheuristic methods, which may exhibit significant variations in search efficiency. To address these challenges, this work evaluates the performance of five state-of-the-art metaheuristics and examines the impact of two penalty methods, death and static, on solution quality, constrained by a limited number of model evaluations due to time constraints. Furthermore, an adjustment to the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) is proposed, targeted at enhancing its exploitation phase in alignment with the established stopping criteria. The algorithm design and selection process adhere to recommendations from literature review articles, employing robust statistical techniques, including Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo sampling to support the replicability of analysis. Results indicate that the adapted MPA is expected to achieve similar error reduction to the other methods but requires 40 % fewer evaluations, thus positioning as the most suitable for the industrial application. The findings are anticipated to provide practical insights for researchers and developers by presenting a case study grounded in best practices to support more effective algorithm design and informed decision-making in real-world optimization challenges. © 2025},

	abstract = {As a highly energy-intensive and carbon-emitting industry with significant emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the petroleum and chemical industry is a major contributor to the global greenhouse effect and ozone layer destruction. Improper treatment of petrochemical waste gas (PWG) seriously harms human health and the natural environment. This study uses CiteSpace and VOSviewer to conduct a scientometric analysis of 1384 scholarly works on PWG and carbon sequestration published between 1981 and 2022, revealing the basic characteristics, knowledge base, research topic evolution, and research hotspots of the field. The results show the following: (1) In the early stages of the petrochemical industry, it was processed tail gas, plant leakage waste gas, and combustion flue gas that were investigated in PWG research. (2) Later, green environmental protection technology was widely studied in the field of PWG treatment, such as biotechnology, catalytic oxidation technology, membrane separation technology, etc., in order to achieve efficient, low energy consumption and low emissions of waste gas treatment, and the number of publications related to this topic has increased rapidly. In addition, researchers studied the internet of things and technology integration, such as the introduction of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and other technologies, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of exhaust gas monitoring, control, and management. (3) The department has focused on how to reduce emissions by optimizing petrochemical process lines or improving energy efficiency. Emission reduction and low-carbon transition in the petrochemical industry will become the main trend in the future. Switching from renewable carbon to feedstock carbon derived from captured carbon dioxide, biomass, or recycled chemicals has become an attractive strategy to help curb emissions from the chemical industry. The results of our analysis can provide funding agencies and research groups with information to better understand the global trends and directions that have emerged in this field from 1981 to 2022 and serve as a reference for future research. © 2024 by the authors.},

The existing problems with HVAC system includes inefficient adjustment to internal room parameters and limited optimization based on varying loads. The current study investigates the influence of Industry 4.0 by assessing internal room parameters in an indoor ventilated room conditions for system output. Smart systems like AI and IoT, integrated with sensors, dynamically adjust indoor conditions based on external climate, enhancing HVAC system efficiency. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), integrated with AI and IoT sensors, optimally adjust indoor conditions in correlation with external climate, maximizing HVAC system efficiency. The study utilizes input parameters including Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT), Relative Humidity (RH), and Solar Radiation across diverse days to analyze system efficiency. ANN and RSM iteratively optimize system efficiency by training on RH, DBT, and air quality data. They converge on recommending 42% RH, 28 °C DBT, and 25 PM air quality, achieving 0.851 desirability. This approach enhances heat load (75.89%) and ventilation load (69.12%) efficiency significantly.

	abstract = {Since adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus has gained increasing attention for its potential to facilitate the implementation of the SDGs. This research emphasizes the necessity of understanding how studies on the WEF nexus have contributed to advancing these global goals. Although the WEF nexus is recognized as a valuable framework connecting multiple SDGs, a systematic literature review assessing its conceptual and empirical contributions has yet to be conducted. Utilizing the PRISMA protocol, this study reviewed relevant publications from Elsevier's SCOPUS database, focusing on the years 2015–2024. Out of 200 initially identified articles, 131 met the inclusion criteria, enriching the body of knowledge surrounding SDG implementation through the WEF nexus. A codebook was developed based on SDGs 2, 6, and 7, revealing 11 cross-cutting themes that highlight critical research gaps to be addressed in future studies and policy development. The analysis showed a predominant focus on WEF nexus governance, efficiency, and environmental protection, with less attention given to target populations, affordability, and international cooperation. Moreover, most studies concentrated on developing countries, with limited research from developed or transitional countries. Notably, 79 % of the analyzed literature contributed empirical insights across 124 countries, indicating significant engagement in examining WEF nexus systems in the context of SDG implementation. By synthesizing existing literature, this study advances the understanding of the WEF nexus's role in supporting the SDGs and highlights critical research gaps that should be addressed in future efforts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A holistic literature review of 399 articles is presented on hybrid solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems and taxonomized through a unique classification methodology that considers primary energy sources, component configurations, system outputs and relevant analysis. In the reviewed research articles, primarily four different types of technologies are used to complement the energy production of the fuel cell stack. As a result, four respective categories were established in terms of the coupling components, inclusive of (1) wind turbines (WTs), (2) solar systems (SS), (3) thermal power plant turbines (TPPTs) and (4) piston engines (PEs). Additional classification was needed to further subdivide the evaluated system configurations, due to the wide spectrum of system outputs encountered in the reviewed literature. That involved (a) electrical power generation (PG), (b) four types of cogeneration (CG), (c) four types of trigeneration (TG) and (d) two types of multigeneration (MG). Depending on the type of assessment in respective research, literature was further categorized as computational, experimental, or both computational and experimental. The most prevalent hybrid system amongst the 102 designs, as adapted from the reviewed literature, is the SOFC/gas turbine (GT) application, with the overwhelming majority producing exclusively electrical power output. The particular system is physically demonstrated in an existing 220-kW experimental facility established by the National Fuel Cell Research Center (NFCRC). The identified systems were predominantly computationally examined and research focused on operating conditions around specific design load ratings. Energy, exergy, economic, and environmental assessments were typically followed by sensitivity studies in the reviewed literature. The primary decision variables in most cases revolved around SOFC operating conditions, such as temperatures over 1000 °C as well as elevated pressures. Those resulted in the deterioration of the electrochemical cell and failed to be addressed by the majority of encountered studies. Improvements in the conversion efficiency of PG applications were enabled by natural gas (NG)-fed pressurized SOFCs, directly coupled to GTs. The most efficient power configuration in terms of thermodynamic performance was achieved by coupling PEs to SOFCs and a metal hydride reactor (MHR) to unlock a maximum net system efficiency of 79.54%. CG systems integrating solar cells (SCs) and photovoltaic panels (PVs) to SOFC subsystems can result in a combined efficiency of approximately 90% and sustain this over a broad energy demand range. TG systems incorporating gasifiers to SOFC/GT subsystems achieved a combined efficiency of 93%, whereas the optimal combined efficiency in MG configurations was identified at 79.5% by coupling SCs to the SOFC/GT/organic Rankine cycle turbine (ORCT) subsystems. In terms of cost-effectiveness, configurations that relied on increasing levels of renewable energy (RE) technologies resulted in high overall levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). This cost was increased further when power storage units were deployed to address wind and solar intermittency challenges. Configurations classified under TPPTs operating on low carbon-content fuels were preferred in terms of providing lower LCOE, while applications operating on gasified biomass and coal blends should deploy additional CO2 capture and storage units to mitigate respective emissions. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study looks into the development of intelligent maritime logistics models that use machine learning approaches to forecast crucial metrics like fuel usage and port delays. A comprehensive dataset assessed five machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. Predictive capacities were assessed using key performance measures such as R², MSE, and MAPE. The results show significant heterogeneity in model performance, with Linear Regression attaining a modest test R² of 0.6845 for fuel prediction and 0.8831 for port delay prediction but suffering from high MSE (58745.23) and MAPE (26.90% for fuel). The Decision Tree showed significant overfitting, with a perfect R² (1.000) on training but decreasing to 0.7743 for fuel and 0.9880 for port delay on testing. Random Forest demonstrated balanced performance, with test R² values of 0.7598 for fuel and 0.9548 for port delay. MAPE values were also lower (23.66% for fuel and 5.66% for port delay). The best-performing model was XGBoost, with near-perfect test R² values of 0.7439 for fuel and 0.9880 for port delay, as well as a low MSE (39579.79 for fuel and 0.23 for port delay). AdaBoost produced comparable but somewhat lower results, with test R² values of 0.7188 for fuel and 0.9485 for port delay. These findings demonstrate XGBoost's strength in capturing nonlinear interactions and making solid predictions, whereas ensemble approaches outperform simpler models such as Linear Regression. © 2025, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

	abstract = {Background: The supplier selection process (SSP) has grown as a crucial mechanism in organizations’ supply chain management (SCM) strategies and as a foundation for continuously gaining a competitive advantage. The concept of the circular economy has garnered significant interest due to its ability to address both environmental and social criteria. It is highly important to carefully choose suppliers across all industries that take into account circular and sustainability issues, as well as traditional criteria. There is very limited research involving the supplier selection process in the Indian HVAC manufacturing sector. Design/Methodology/Approach: Thus, this study aimed to determine the critical factors for sustainable supplier selection for HVAC manufacturing firms using a mixed research method with three stages: a secondary study, the Delphi method, and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Thirty-two critical sub-factors were identified and grouped into eight major factors: delivery, economic, environmental, social, management and organization, quality, services, and supplier relationship. Results/Conclusions: For HVAC manufacturing firms, the major factors of delivery, quality, and economics were found to be top-ranked among the factors, followed by environmental factors. Studies in developing countries using sustainable factors are still nascent, especially in India. Originality/Value: This study’s novelty lies with the proposed eight major factors, comprising all facets of organizations, including sustainability factors. Supplier selection in HVAC manufacturing firms is exhaustively dealt with in this study, filling a gap in the existing literature. This is important because HVAC products are high-energy-consuming, high-energy-releasing, and costly. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have been widely adopted in energy systems due to their many advantages. However, the high energy density and thermal stability issues associated with lithium-ion batteries have led to a rise in BESS-related safety incidents, which often bring about severe casualties and property losses. To accurately evaluate the safety of lithium-ion BESS, this study proposes a probabilistic risk assessment method (PRA) that incorporates fuzzy fault tree analysis (FFTA) with expert knowledge aggregation. This approach takes into account the impact of BESS design variations and provides risk probability estimates for safety incidents in BESS. Based on the risk assessment, an energy system design framework is developed. This framework introduces a quantified risk indicator for BESS and establishes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to examine the implications of BESS design on self-safety, as well as its interactive effects on the economics of integrated energy systems (IES). A case study conducted in an industrial park in Ningde, China, demonstrates that differences in safety requirements from investors can lead to cost variations of up to 6.8%. Furthermore, the study reveals the deep coupling between the safety and economics of BESS, highlighting that a cost-optimal approach which neglects safety can result in a 4.5% increase in the probability of BESS safety incident risk compared to a safety-optimal approach. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the interplay between safety and economics in BESS design.

	abstract = {The utilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its corresponding methodologies gained considerable attention within the realm of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability assessment. Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate the extent to which these methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods, economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of 144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning sustainability assessment. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {As global Supply Chains (SCs) face increasing complexities and risks, organizations must balance operational efficiency with preparedness for unforeseen disruptions. Recent events, including the devastating floods or wildfires and the impacts of the volatility of international relations, have underscored the vulnerability of SCs. The study explores the critical need for combining supply chain management, risk management, and sustainability for the systematic analysis of disruption risks from the unpredictability of natural disasters, man-made events, and rapid technological advancements. We develop a decision support system integrating the fuzzy C-means clustering and integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach for risk categorization and prioritization, respectively. The developed framework considers the significance of multiple risk factors (e.g., urgency and vulnerability) in the risk disruption analysis process through the hybrid Bayesian best-worst method-combined compromise solution approach. This enables managers to identify critical disruption risks (e.g., communication network disruptions, production facility-related risk, and increased demand for certain goods) while observing their adverse effects on the resiliency of sustainable SCs. Compared to the traditional risk priority number, the proposed system includes the importance of risk factors and provides a more stable and separable ranking, empowering managers to deal with potential resource limitations. This study also suggests risk mitigation strategies to alleviate the negative consequences of disruptions within organizational constraints and improve sustainable SC responsiveness to future disasters. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Currently, urban areas are confronting considerable challenges stemming from climate change. These challenges possess the potential to have profound implications for the well-being of residents, their means of making a living, and their own assets. Consequently, it is imperative to identify effective solutions that mitigate these effects on the urban environment. Nature-based solutions (NBSs), involving the utilization of natural resources and ecosystem services to alleviate the effects of climate change, have the potential of enhancing our capacity to develop cities that are more resistant to these challenges. To this end, this paper aims to extract some bibliographic data from available research articles on NBSs and climate resilience sought from the common search engines of Scopus, Web of Science, and Lens Base, and then the RStudio version 2022.12.00+353, VoSviewer version 1.6.20, and Biblioshiny-Bibliometrics version 2017 software tools were adopted to collate and analyze the literature data through science mapping analysis. In doing so, it was advocated that these two topics have not been extensively studied in their relationship to each other and that there is a large extent of existing knowledge gaps, the filling of which can foster the development of these ideas and thus help develop our cities in combating against climate change. Exploring the effectiveness of NBSs in boosting climate resilience is a critical research gap. More empirical studies are envisaged to assess the scalability and transferability of those effective NBSs in various regions or countries. Another research gap exists in comprehending the long-term effects on ecosystem services and community welfare. Research on socio-economic advantages, trade-offs, and unintended outcomes is essential for making well-informed decisions when applying various NBSs worldwide. © 2024 by the authors.},

With the dynamic progression of modern manufacturing technologies, the emergence of numerous black-box models characterized by inaccessible mathematical formulations and high evaluation costs poses new challenges to traditional optimization methods, leading to difficulty in programming and solving. Hence, based on the trust region filter (TRF) method, we define a new framework to elevate optimization efficiency in this study for chemical systems involving computationally expensive black-box functions. Sampling size per iteration is reduced, and sampling efficiency is improved by incorporating the known data beyond the trust region to assist in constructing reduced models, which is achieved by the application of the Gaussian process. Through comparison and validation of benchmark tests and case studies, this approach demonstrates that using the Gaussian process as the reduced model can lower the number of calls to black-box functions by more than half compared to common linear and quadratic models, and convergence to first-order critical points can still be guaranteed. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The proliferation of electric vehicle (EV) adoption strains low-voltage distribution networks, particularly in aggregated charging scenarios, prompting utility companies to incentivize charging aggregators for optimizing load balancing within thermal limits. These aggregators utilize machine learning algorithms to understand electricity price signals and orchestrate the optimization of the EV charging process. However, conventional machine learning approaches fall short when dealing with the dynamic and volatile nature of electricity prices, emphasizing the necessity for advanced ensemble models. This paper introduces a novel Deep-Weighted Ensemble Model (DWEM) rooted in standard and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks designed for wholesale electricity price forecasting, to manage the EV charging at the aggregator level. The ensemble development process involves developing an architecture that highlights the significance of the DWEM model in supporting aggregators for the charging optimization of EVs. The charging optimization problem of aggregated EVs is formulated, and the heuristic mechanism is systematically presented, evaluating various weight configurations, and selecting those characterized by the highest levels of accuracy to comprise the ensemble model. Moreover, we incorporated a standard deviation mechanism to evaluate the impact of the proposed DWEM on forecasting accuracy, mean squared error, and mean absolute error across various standard deviation levels. We leveraged a publicly available Houston electricity dataset and performed a detailed data engineering mechanism, accounting for data both with and without outliers. Subsequently, we applied the proposed DWEM to this dataset and conducting three types of comparative analysis: (a) evaluating model performance in terms of accuracy, mean square error, and mean absolute error; (b) assessing aggregator charging analysis focusing on charging load and cost; and (c) analyzing computational complexity and execution time. The simulation results demonstrated a improvement in accuracy and reduction in charging load and cost compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive computational complexity. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Biomass and waste power generation holds the promise to secure electricity supply for a growing population and mitigate global warming simultaneously. Along with the increasing commission and installation of biomass/waste power units (BWPUs) across the globe, some BWPUs failures have been observed, including the cancellation of planned/commissioned BWPUs and the termination of those in operation before reaching their natural retirement. While empirical evidence suggests that factors like feedstock accessibility and policy instruments might affect the feasibility and performance of BWPUs, there is a lack of comprehensive investigation about why some BWPUs failed at the global scale. To fill this knowledge gap, this study quantifies the hazard ratio of BWPUs via a parametric survival analysis using a panel dataset covering a total of 12,829 BWPUs (relying on woody, non-woody, and waste biomass as raw feedstocks) located in 164 countries/regions worldwide for the period of 2001–2021. The analytical results suggest that large unit size is conducive to BWPUs failure, while feedstock accessibility and the implementation of policy instruments (including Feed-in-Tariff and carbon pricing) could largely reduce the hazard ratio of BWPUs, with varying impacts on BWPUs at the planned/commissioned stage or the operation stage, located in developed or developing countries. Our findings not only shed additional light on the fate of BWPUs, which is crucial to enriching our understanding about the development of the bioenergy sector worldwide, but also provide salient empirical evidence for policy-making in terms of ensuring feedstock accessibility, overcoming diseconomies of scale, and making fiscal instruments available and transparent to boost the confidence of investors and entrepreneurs in support of BWPUs development. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Computational techniques are applied to catalyst design and deactivation, reaction and reactor optimization, stability assessment, waste feedstock analysis, process scale-up, reaction mechanims, and molecular dynamics simulation. Waste feedstock comprise cooking oil, animal fat, vegetable oil, algae, fish waste, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. Waste cooking oil represents about 10% of global biodiesel production, and restaurants alone produce over 1,000,000 m3 of waste vegetable oil annual. Microalgae produces 250 times more oil per acre than soybeans and 7–31 times more oil than palm oil. Transesterification of food waste lipids can produce biodiesel with a 100% yield.

By employing deep learning, we construct problem-specific heuristics that identify and exploit common structures across MIP instances. We train deep learning models to estimate complicating binary variables for target MIP problem instances. The resulting reduced MIP models are solved using standard off-the-shelf solvers. We present an algorithm for generating synthetic data enhancing the robustness and generalizability of our models across diverse MIP instances. We compare the effectiveness of (a) feed-forward neural networks (ANN) and (b) convolutional neural networks (CNN). To enhance the framework's performance, we employ Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, aiming to maximize the occurrence of global optimum solutions. We apply this framework to a flow-based facility location allocation MIP formulation that describes long-term investment planning and medium-term tactical scheduling in a personalized medicine supply chain. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In recent years, biofuel production has attracted considerable attention, especially given the increasing worldwide demand for energy and emissions of greenhouse gases that threaten this planet. In this case, one possible solution is to convert biomass into green and sustainable biofuel, which can enhance the bioeconomy and contribute to sustainable economic development goals. Due to being in large quantities and containing high organic content, various biomass sources such as food waste, textile waste, microalgal waste, agricultural waste and sewage sludge have gained significant attention for biofuel production. Also, biofuel production technologies, including thermochemical processing, anaerobic digestion, fermentation and bioelectrochemical systems, have been extensively reported, which can achieve waste valorization through producing biofuels and re-utilizing wastes. Nevertheless, the commercial feasibility of biofuel production is still being determined, and it is unclear whether biofuel can compete equally with other existing fuels in the market. The concept of a circular economy in biofuel production can promote the environmentally friendly and sustainable valorization of biomass waste. This review comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art production of biofuel from various biomass sources and the bioeconomy perspectives associated with it. Biofuel production is evaluated within the framework of the bioeconomy. Further perspectives on possible integration approaches to maximizing waste utilization for biofuel production are discussed, and what this could mean for the circular economy. More research related to pretreatment and machine learning of biofuel production should be conducted to optimize the biofuel production process, increase the biofuel yield and make the biofuel prices competitive. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Efforts of this nature strive to offer sustainable energy storage solutions that are both dependable and environmentally friendly. This report presents a review a thorough an examination of the aforementioned technologies, with a particular emphasis on cost-effectiveness and State of Charge (SoC) administration. Furthermore, it comprehensively assesses their specific advantages and downsides. Sodium-based systems, such as sodium-sulfur batteries, exhibit remarkable stability and efficiency in sustaining desired charge levels, starting from the control of SoC. Lithium-based alternatives, such as Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have gained extensive usage adopted in several industries because to their enhanced energy density and improved SoC accuracy. The complexity associated with SoC is a challenge for hydrogen-based systems, including hydrogen fuel cells, due to their dependence on gas storage and conversion techniques. The assessment places significant emphasis on cost analysis, which evaluates the economic feasibility of each storage method. Sodium-based systems, known for their well-established technology and ample availability of raw materials, frequently present a financially viable option, especially for large-scale grid implementations. The pricing of lithium-based systems, particularly in the domains of portable devices and electric cars, is competitive because to their quick improvements and decreasing costs. Hydrogen-based systems, despite their initial expensive capital expenditure, exhibit potential through continuous advancements and the expansion of production capacity. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Among natural gas-based hydrogen production methods, autothermal reforming (ATR) has a high efficiency for carbon capture and storage integration due to the high CO2 levels at the reactor outlet. This study proposes an integrated system (ATR/HLU–LOX) that utilizes liquefied oxygen (LOX) in the precooling stage of the hydrogen liquefaction unit (HLU) to reduce liquefaction energy costs and CO2 intensity. This conducted an enviro-techno-economic analysis for large-scale hydrogen production (100 tonnes/day) suitable for natural gas valorization and hydrogen storage. Additionally, this study evaluated the performance of a CCS-based ATR system (ATR–CCS/HLU–LOX) and compared it to LOX-free liquefaction unit (ATR/HLU and ATR-CCS/HLU). For further comparison, grey and blue steam methane reforming (SMR) for hydrogen generation was also investigated (i.e., SMR/HLU and SMR–CCS/HLU systems). The main findings of this study depicted that ATR–CCS/HLU–LOX reduced specific energy consumption by 6.6% and lowered the levelized cost of hydrogen and global warming impact by 1.3 and 11.0%, respectively, compared to SMR–CCS/HLU. This achievement can encourage adopting ATR for various applications (e.g., flare gas treatment, blue hydrogen generation, and subsurface NG valorization) instead of high CO2 emitting SMR. © 2024},

This study explores the impacts of municipal strategic decisions on household waste management behaviours and sustainability performance outcomes through agent-based modelling. Using data from Gatineau and Beaconsfield in Quebec, Canada, the model is calibrated and validated to represent diverse urban contexts. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing collection frequency leads to notable increases in participation rates, reaching 78.2 ± 5.1% for collections every two weeks and 96.5 ± 8.3% for collections every five weeks. While this reduction improves bin filling levels, it concurrently decreases the recovery of recyclable materials by 2.8% and 19.5%, significantly undermining the environmental benefits of the recycling program. These findings highlight a complex interplay between collection frequency, citizen participation behaviour, waste stream characteristics, and overall environmental performance. While reducing collection frequency initially appears beneficial, it leads to operational challenges and increased CO2 emissions due to reduced material recovery. The research emphasises the need for tailored holistic waste management strategies that optimise performance outcomes while minimising environmental impacts. By understanding these dynamics, municipalities can develop more effective waste management policies that promote sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this work, an integrated system for hydrogen energy utilization system (HUS) in oil and gas fields was constructed focusing on two scenarios: hydrogen fuel cell bus and industrial combustion. The energy consumption, environmental, economic, and energy efficiency were assessed for the various HUS technological pathways associated with produced water treatment, hydrogen production, transport and storage, refueling, and utilization. The entropy weight-TOPSIS method was utilized to assess the optimal pathway. The results indicate that the pathway of alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production and pipeline transportation to gas-hydrogen refueling stations for hydrogen fuel cell bus shows excellent comprehensive indicators, which has an energy consumption of 197.15 MJ/kgH2, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 6.70 USD/kgH2, a system energy efficiency of 30.43%. For industrial combustion, the best pathway is alkaline water electrolysis for hydrogen production and pure H2 pipeline transportation. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of different factors on LCOH. As the electricity price decreases to 0.014 USD/kWh, LCOH will reduce by 2.50 USD/kgH2. The reduction in electricity prices will further increase the feasibility of hydrogen energy in the future. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Several countries have focused on achieving optimal economic growth in the past decades, which has caused diverse environmental concerns among policymakers and managers. The present study aims to introduce new metric using mathematical modeling to examine strategies to promote environmental performance in OECD countries. Thus, we propose a target-oriented Distance Friction Minimization (TO-DFM) model to design a practical improvement strategy for low-efficiency DMUs. In this regard, considering the efficient and inefficient frontiers, we present two models, IDMU and ADMU, respectively, based on TO-DFM and DFM models. Then, the distance scores yielded by the two models are combined to evaluate the efficiency of each DMU using the hybrid index of relative closeness (RC). The results reveal that the proposed model has a better distinctive potential compared to the standard TO-DFM model. Overall, implementing the proposed model on a set of sustainability data, for OECD countries, resulted in a more logical performance in classifying countries regarding their distance from the efficient and inefficient frontiers. Therefore, less developed countries should pay considerable attention to implementing environmental policies to improve their performance and control environmental pollution with a reliable and healthy economy. For instance, the implementation of such policies in countries such as Turkey, Estonia, and Hungary, with lower efficiency scores, can affect the sustainability of their development performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

AI/ML technologies are used in various aspects of microalgae processes, such as real-time monitoring, species identification, the optimization of growth conditions, harvesting, and the purification of bioproducts. Commonly employed ML algorithms, including the support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithm (GA), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and deep learning (DL), each have unique strengths but also present challenges, such as computational demands, overfitting, and transparency. Despite these hurdles, AI/ML technologies have shown significant improvements in system performance, scalability, and resource efficiency, as well as in cutting costs, minimizing downtime, and reducing environmental impact. However, broader implementations face obstacles, including data availability, model complexity, scalability issues, cybersecurity threats, and regulatory challenges. To address these issues, solutions, such as the use of simulation-based data, modular system designs, and adaptive learning models, have been proposed.

	abstract = {Many nations obtain their energy from fossil fuels. The benefit of renewable energy is that it decreases the dependence on conventional fuel, and minimizes carbon emissions. However, the commercial feasibility of multi-biofuel production poses a major challenge. A resilient and cost-efficient biofuel supply chain network is essential for commercialization. Furthermore, disruption risks arise from operational downtime, labor strikes, natural disasters, and uncertainty embedded in the data compromise the effectiveness of tactical and strategic level supply chain planning. In line with the aforementioned requirements, a multi-biofuel supply chain network model that reduces the total system cost and accounts for both disruption and operational risks is proposed. The proposed model determines the optimal production–distribution quantities and supports facility location and capacity decisions against multiple supply and demand interruption scenarios. The lead time crashing cost is utilized here to reduce the lead time, which increases because of transportation disruptions. To decrease energy expenses and carbon emissions, a variable production rate is applied for creating an economic way to advance the manufacturing industry. The model aims to show bioenergy's effect on making a sustainable multi-biofuel supply chain network. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. It is seen that by utilizing the presented method, the production cost of biofuels is significantly reduced through minimized energy consumption and carbon emissions. Moreover, the impact of critical parameters on the total system cost is explained through sensitivity analysis and graphical representations. The effort provides a systematic guideline for designing various environmental, economic, and social aspects of a sustainable supply chain network for bioenergy under minimized consumption. Multi-biofuel producers, distributors, investors, and the regulators surely be benefitted from the proposed model. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries is uncertain throughout lifecycle battery-related activities. In this study, a generic methodology is proposed to accurately quantify the lifecycle carbon intensity of electrochemical batteries. A cross-scale multi-stage analytic platform with inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary is formulated, involving battery materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte), charging/discharging behaviours, cascade battery utilization, recycling, and reproduction. A case study on a zero-energy district in subtropical Guangzhou indicates that lifetime EV battery carbon intensity is +556 kg CO2,eq/kWh for the scenario with pure fossil fuel-based grid reliance, while the minimum carbon intensity of EVs at −860 kg CO2,eq/kWh can be achieved for the solar-wind supported scenario. The grid mandatory EVs charging will slightly increase the battery carbon intensity to −617.2 kg CO2,eq/kWh, and the exclusion of embodied carbon on both solar PV and wind turbines will increase the battery carbon intensity to −583.8 kg CO2,eq/kWh.

	abstract = {The marine sector is an important contributor to global black carbon (BC) emissions, which can negatively affect air quality and climate. Biofuel advancement provides a green substitute for traditional maritime fuels, which could help in meeting the almost unreasonable emission reduction targets laid down by International Maritime Organization (IMO). This study reviews some engineering-oriented biofuel applications that seem to effectively minimize BC emissions from marine propulsion systems without sacrifice of the operational performance metric. Biofuels (hydrotreated vegetable oil [HVO] and biodiesel from algae or other processing routes) show the potential to reduce BC emissions by 50–80 % under controlled conditions in medium-speed diesel engines. For example, a marine trial using 50:50 HVO-diesel demonstrated up to a 60 % reduction in BC emissions compared with fossil fuels but maintained engine performance. Qualitatively, enhanced combustion properties due to the relatively high cetane number and low aromatic content in biofuels compared with those of petroleum fuels result in lower soot emissions when burning biofuels. Lifecycle assessments show greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reductions of up to 75 % when biofuels displace heavy fuel oil (HFO) in terms of quantitative measurements. Increased biofuel scalability to marine fuel applications is due in part to technological advancements, such as catalytic cracking of lignocellulosic biomass and microbial fermentation of seaweed. Biofuels save less than a ton of CO₂ per cubic meter as they are hard to store and incorporate during the fuel production process, but they still represent an appropriate tool in decarbonizing shipping and complying with international climate goals. This review highlights the transformational function of biofuels in enabling sustainable marine propulsion. © 2025},

	abstract = {In the modern tourism landscape, the fusion of sustainability and personalized travel plans marks a significant paradigm shift. This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization approach for crafting sustainable and personalized tourist trip plans. The proposed model is designed to provide tailored recommendations to tourists, simultaneously minimizing total costs, environmental impacts, and maximizing individual preferences. These recommendations encompass choices such as hotel and resting place selection, daily sequence of attractions, precise visit schedules, and preferred modes of transportation. Addressing intricacies within an urban multi-modal transport system, including factors like traffic lights, weather conditions, and distinct features of each transport mode, the model ensures that tourists can explore scenic spots within their available time windows. To tackle uncertainties in travel time, travel costs, and visit durations, a practical fuzzy optimization approach is employed. For efficient resolution of the multi-objective optimization model, a self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm based on Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (SA-NSGAII) is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed solution method is verified through comparisons with Augmented ε-Constraint (AUGMECON) and NSGA-II methods, utilizing various benchmark examples. Employing real data from Montreal, an empirical case study is conducted to illustrate the application of the sustainable and personalized trip planning model. The analysis of the solution results demonstrates how this approach can assist tourists in achieving a harmonious balance between sustainability objectives and making well-informed decisions based on their individual preferences. © 2024},

	abstract = {Global warming and population growth have significantly intensified the challenges in securing drinking water supplies. This study investigates transient instabilities of streamflow using ensemble machine learning (EML) and machine learning (ML) methodologies on the South Platte river in the United States. The United States Geological Survey's online database was utilized to obtain the primary dataset. Several technical approaches were employed for preprocessing the initial dataset: cleaning outlier data, clean missing data, and 10 fold cross-validation. Nonlinear programming, genetic algorithms, least squares, linear programming, gradient descent, particle swarm optimization, Nelder Mead, and simulated annealing were employed algorithms to develop eight-weighted EML models. The results showed that the ensemble learning approach and the aggregation of weak learners by mentioned algorithms have been significantly successful. Particularly, the nonlinear programming-EML (NLP-EML) outperformed others, achieving the highest prediction accuracy with an R2 coefficient equal to 0.97. The probability density function showed that NLP-EML was the most reliable model. Overall, the findings highlight the superior performance and reliability of EML approaches in hydrological modeling, offering practical guidance to experts on the creation of robust ensemble models for improved prediction accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and industrial ecology (IE) is gaining significant attention due to AI's potential to enhance the sustainability of production and consumption systems. Understanding the current state of research in this field can highlight covered topics, identify trends, and reveal understudied topics warranting future research. However, few studies have systematically reviewed this intersection. In this study, we analyze 1068 publications within the IE–AI domain using trend factor analysis, word2vec modeling, and top2vec modeling. These methods uncover patterns of topic interconnections and evolutionary trends. Our results identify 71 trending terms within the selected publications, 69 of which, such as “deep learning,” have emerged in the past 8 years. The word2vec analysis shows that the application of various AI techniques is increasingly integrated into life cycle assessment and the circular economy. The top2vec analysis suggests that employing AI to predict and optimize indicators related to products, waste, processes, and their environmental impacts is an emerging trend. Lastly, we propose that fine-tuning large language models to better understand and process data specific to IE, along with deploying real-time data collection technologies such as sensors, computer vision, and robotics, could effectively address the challenges of data-driven decision-making in this domain. © 2025 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology.},

This study explored the influence of catalysts, temperature, heating rate, and residence time on the pyrolysis process, and addressed their effects on product distribution and composition. Safety considerations and strategies for mitigating the potential environmental impacts of pyrolysis were presented. Comparative analyses of the environmental impacts of traditional waste disposal methods versus pyrolysis-based approaches provided insights into the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The circular economy approach was explored in the context of medical plastic waste pyrolysis. The potential for closing the loop by transforming plastic waste into valuable resources was addressed. The integration of pyrolysis-derived products into existing supply chains was discussed in detail. The role of simulation technology, with an emphasis on Aspen Plus, in optimizing the plastic pyrolysis process was explained. The integration of simulation technology allowed for the prediction and optimization of product yields, energy consumption, and overall process efficiency. The application of AI-enabled predictive maintenance, early detection of process anomalies, and adaptive control strategies contributing to safer and more efficient pyrolysis operations. The integration of pyrolysis-derived products into existing supply chains was studied, illustrating how they can serve as raw materials for manufacturing new products, thereby reducing the demand for virgin resources.

Disruption of food supply chains can lead to significant economic challenges. Building a resilient supply chain requires resources; however, it is difficult for firms to allocate resources to various resilience strategies. This study allocates the budget to resilient capacity, that is, absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacity, to minimize supply chain costs and maximize service levels. We developed a novel multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming method for problem formulation. The developed model was converted into an equivalent linear model. We used the Monte Carlo approach to generate the scenarios and the average sample approximation to determine the required scenarios. Finally, the Lexicographic max-min approach solves the model using actual data from a dairy supply chain. The analysis revealed that allocating 50% of the budget to restorative capacity and the remaining to adaptive and absorptive capacity optimizes supply chain performance. This study provides insights for managers to make better decisions with a knowledge-based background, allocate resources to various resilient strategies, and build a more resilient and efficient supply chain. © The authors.

	abstract = {At present, as the problem of water shortage and pollution is growing serious, it is particularly important to understand the recycling and treatment of wastewater. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is characterized by reliable mapping of nonlinear behaviors between input and output of experimental data, and thus single/integrated AI model algorithms for predicting different pollutants or water quality parameters have become a popular method for simulating the process of wastewater treatment. Many AI models have successfully predicted the removal effects of pollutants in different wastewater treatment processes. Therefore, this paper reviews the applications of artificial intelligence technologies such as artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM). Meanwhile, this review mainly introduces the effectiveness and limitations of artificial intelligence technology in predicting different pollutants (dyes, heavy metal ions, antibiotics, etc.) and different water quality parameters such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in wastewater treatment process, involving single AI model and integrated AI model. Finally, the problems that need further research together with challenges ahead in the application of artificial intelligence models in the field of environment are discussed and presented. © 2024},

	abstract = {Increasing the production of the three major food crops (MFCs), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), is essential to fulfilling the food demand for the growing human population. Increasing food production may require the integration of machine learning (ML) into plant breeding programs. However, developing ML tools to improve the production of MFCs is a daunting task due to the lack of quality data and the computation resources needed to process this information. Hence, this review discusses the recent applications of ML for improving MFCs production, including plant phenotyping, yield forecasting, and candidate gene prediction. Based on the challenges reported in recent ML experiments for MFCs, this review prescribes solutions to produce scalable ML models. This review provides valuable insights for future studies and promotes collective efforts among researchers implementing ML to enhance MFCs productivity. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {This review article explores how emerging generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), can enhance solution methodologies within process systems engineering (PSE). These cutting-edge GenAI models, particularly foundation models (FMs), which are pre-trained on extensive, general-purpose datasets, offer versatile adaptability for a broad range of tasks, including responding to queries, image generation, and complex decision-making. Given the close relationship between advancements in PSE and developments in computing and systems technologies, exploring the synergy between GenAI and PSE is essential. We begin our discussion with a compact overview of both classic and emerging GenAI models, including FMs, and then dive into their applications within key PSE domains: synthesis and design, optimization and integration, and process monitoring and control. In each domain, we explore how GenAI models could potentially advance PSE methodologies, providing insights and prospects for each area. Furthermore, the article identifies and discusses potential challenges in fully leveraging GenAI within PSE, including multiscale modeling, data requirements, evaluation metrics and benchmarks, and trust and safety, thereby deepening the discourse on effective GenAI integration into systems analysis, design, optimization, operations, monitoring, and control. This paper provides a guide for future research focused on the applications of emerging GenAI in PSE. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Polycarbonate has a wide range of applications in electronic devices and medicine because of its remarkable properties such as transparency and mechanical strength. However, the polycarbonate production process using diphenyl carbonate leads to the inevitable generation of nitrogen oxide (NOx) from byproduct incineration. Therefore, it is essential to optimize the process conditions while simultaneously considering the production costs and NOx emissions. Herein, we propose a multi-objective optimization model for sustainable and economical polycarbonate production using a high-fidelity reaction model for real-world industrial processes. Additionally, a data-driven model was developed using industrial data to identify the operating conditions that minimize NOx emissions and maximize profitability. Four of the ten reaction parameters were selected through variance-based global sensitivity analysis, and the posterior distribution of each parameter was determined through Bayesian inference. In addition, NOx emissions were predicted using the data-driven model developed from industrial data. A process model with coefficients of determination above 0.7 and a data-driven model with R-squared value above 0.99 for pilot-scale experimental and industrial data were generated using our approach. The Pareto optimality, identified based on the developed models, suggested operating conditions that optimize both economic and environmental benefits. Consequently, NOx emissions could be reduced by 27.2%–27.4% and the unit costs of production could be reduced by 0.8%–1.6% compared with the base case. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Risks are uncertain events that can affect criteria such as project cost, quality, and completion time and ultimately lead to project failure. That is why the project risk management process, which is one of the most fundamental parts of project management, must be done properly. In this paper, a new multi-objective fuzzy model is proposed to respond appropriately to the primary and secondary project risks. The contributions, such as risk interdependency, considering the project with multi-mode activities, resource considerations, as well as attention to interval-valued fuzzy uncertainties are regarded simultaneously for the first time. The purpose of the proposed multi-objective mathematical model is to minimize cost, quality reduction, and project completion time. Then, a new two-stage uncertain solution approach is introduced in this paper. In this solution approach, using an equivalent method in the first step and then using an extended multi-choice goal programming method in the second step, for both lower and upper limits of the membership functions for interval-valued fuzzy numbers, the computational processes are performed. To show the application and effectiveness of the proposed model, a case study adapted from the literature is given. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyze the behavior of the developed mixed-integer programming model. The analysis of obtained results indicates that the utilization of the proposed model leads to better and more appropriate solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Optimizing supplier selections is an open ended problem, relevant to the operational performance of both individual companies and entire supply chains. Considering the prediction of future occurrences of delays in the optimization of supplier selections is still an under covered problem. Unlike existing literature, this article suggests a more collaborative and integrated workflow to improve the visibility and involvement of multiple stakeholders in the supplier selection decision-making processes. This is achieved through enhanced collaboration between multiple stakeholders (suppliers, customers, decision-makers from different departments, in addition to data sources from information systems), and better integration between data analysis and decision-making, through data-driven-machine-learning and optimization. The specificities of a French company in the furniture industry are considered. A workflow model is designed to support information sharing and to streamline knowledge and interactions between multiple stakeholders from different expertise domains. A Collaborative Predictive Optimization System (CPOS) is designed to classify expected occurrences of delays, to optimize order allocations, and to enable stakeholder collaboration. Delay prediction involves Decision Trees, Random Forests, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Supplier selection is solved using mathematical programming, while considering the classification of expected occurrences of delays. Stakeholder collaboration relies on information systems and uses prediction and optimization to support finding satisfactory agreements. The approach is validated using a real 3.5-year dataset, including 139 suppliers, 7,934 products and 89,080 purchase orders. A detailed experimentation, including sensitivity analysis, best–worst case analysis, and a larger scale analysis on company datasets, shows that the suggested approach enhances collaboration and achieves delay reduction and total procurement cost savings. Valuable managerial insights are collected, including the necessity to adopt digital technologies, to adapt company workflows, and to improve upstream negotiations and supplier commitments to yearly plannings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To mitigate losses from public health emergencies, promptly choosing an emergency medical supply distribution center is essential. The success of rescues hinges on the center’s location. Location decision for such centers is fraught with uncertainty and risk, complicating the task for decision makers (DMs). Often, DMs operate under bounded rationality in urgent situations. In response, this paper introduces a novel fuzzy multicriteria decision-making approach, integrating interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) effect, and cumulative prospect theory, to address the uncertainty and risk in decision-making. The method begins by introducing the NIMBY effect to construct the evaluation criteria system of emergency medical supply distribution centers. Next, the alternative under the evaluation criteria is evaluated by fuzzy linguistic terms and interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used to determine the weight of each DM by calculating the relative scores of advantage and disadvantage. The criteria weight is determined via a combination of fuzzy network analysis and the entropy weight method. Cumulative prospect theory is then employed to rank site selections, factoring in DM risk preferences. The approach is tested on an emergency medical supply distribution center location for sensitivity and comparative analysis, proving its efficacy and stability. This research presents an innovative fuzzy model for evaluating emergency medical supply distribution center site selection in uncertain conditions, suggesting the need to incorporate multiple dimensions such as realistic criteria systems, uncertain decision information, and variable environments in such decision-making processes. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association 2024.},

	abstract = {The demand for hydrogen is increasing every year and is expected to increase in the future which necessitates the establishment of safe storage of hydrogen for the end user. Hydrogen needs to overcome many challenges and the critical challenge is to achieve convenient, safe, and economical storage of hydrogen. Therefore, storing hydrogen at high pressure can mitigate the challenge of storing hydrogen to some extent. This paper found that among different types of cylinders, type IV is suitable for storing hydrogen at high pressure, NH3B3 and LiBH4 hydrides have higher hydrogen capacities and LOHCs such as methanol and 1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborine have higher hydrogen storage capacities than other hydrides and LOHCs respectively. To meet the global demand for hydrogen, large scale storage such as underground storage in depleted reservoirs, salt caverns, and aquifers can be an excellent option. The capability to store and release hydrogen from ammonia under controlled environments makes it a potential candidate for renewable energy storage and transportation applications, contributing to the transition towards a sustainable energy future. Ammonia oxidation for hydrogen storage represents an innovative approach to utilise the energy potential of ammonia as a carrier for hydrogen and this paper finds that ammonia offers several advantages, including its high hydrogen content by weight, ease of handling and transport compared to pure hydrogen, and existing infrastructure for production and distribution. Hydrogen production, consumption, and future demands are discussed and elaborated in the present research. This paper summarises the safety and cost of hydrogen storage. Furthermore, the paper rigorously addresses the ongoing challenges hindering the practical implementation of hydrogen storage technologies available. This comprehensive assessment offers a current overview of the state-of-the-art in hydrogen storage technologies, outlining both the significant progress made and the pivotal challenges that need attention. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Assessing carbon emission reduction potential is vital for achieving carbon peak and neutrality in the maritime sector. In this study, we proposed a universal framework for assessing the effectiveness of different measures on carbon emission reduction from ships, including port and ship electrification (PSE), ship speed optimization (SSO), and clean fuel substitution (CFS). Firstly, the projection method of future ship traffic flows and activity levels relies on a neural network, and the ARIMA model was proposed. Then, the potential of various emission reduction measures was detailed and analyzed under different intensity scenarios. The proposed model was applied to Wuhan port, the results indicate that CFS is the most effective for long-term decarbonization, potentially achieving a carbon peak by 2025 under an aggressive scenario. For the short to medium term, PSE is favored due to technical maturity. SSO primarily delays emissions growth, making it a suitable auxiliary measure. These findings guide emission reduction strategies for ports, fostering green and sustainable shipping development. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Energy policy has a significant impact on the state of the environment and, therefore, on residents’ health and life expectancy, especially in highly urbanized areas. Reducing emissions is currently one of the necessary actions that must be taken at the scale of individual countries to ensure sustainable development. The article aims to identify the best ways to shape energy policy by evaluating development scenarios for air protection and their environmental impact. The realization of the goal is based on the data included in three groups: (1) Economic factors, Health factors, and Demographic factors; (2) Clima-e related economic losses, Renewable Energy sources in electricity, heating, and cooling, Premature deaths due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), Health impacts of air pollution, Population change; (3) Demographic balance and crude rates at the national level, GDP per capita in purchasing power PPS, GDP, and principal components; covering 36 EU countries in 2019 and 2021. The study proposes an advanced methodology for assessing development strategies by integrating the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Bayesian networks (BN) and incorporating them into a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) support system. The TOPSIS model based on BN allowed for the illustration of the features of many criteria and the identification of relationships between scenarios, allowing for selecting the best way to develop energy policy. The results showed a 60.39% chance of achieving success in extending the life of residents by five years. At the same time, the most favorable development path was the scenario promoting activities aimed at reducing air pollution by introducing renewable energy sources to produce energy used for lighting and preparing domestic hot water urban areas. By presenting possible scenarios and the probability of success, it is possible to achieve the goal of practical energy policy at the level of the country and individual European cities and also by extending the life of city inhabitants, as presented by the authors in this study. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The increasing global demand for renewable energy necessitates accurate forecasting methods to optimize wind energy production, particularly in regions with varying climatic conditions. This study addresses this need by utilizing advanced deep learning techniques and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to estimate the energy output of wind turbines. Specifically, it focuses on predicting the energy production of both horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) using a combination of Markov and Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) models, alongside deep learning methods such as long short-term memory (LSTM), LSTM-Wavelet, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Additionally, the study evaluates the energy output of each turbine type, factoring in their construction costs within the study area. The analysis reveals significant variations in energy output over time, with maximum values increasing from 85,017 Wh in 2000 to 166,050 Wh in 2020 in the northern region, while minimum outputs also rose significantly. Projections for 2030 suggest that approximately 17% of the northern region experience a substantial increase in wind power potential. Among the forecasting methods, the LSTM-Wavelet hybrid model demonstrated superior accuracy, surpassing the 90% threshold, primarily due to its effective handling of data instability and noise reduction. This study underscores the potential of using sophisticated modeling techniques to enhance wind energy forecasting, contributing to more efficient energy management in regions with high energy demand and limited resources. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study examines reliability of equipment (RoE) through three approaches: equipment design reliability, human reliability (HR), and maintenance-based reliability. HR plays a key role in minimizing human error (HE) and subsequently enhancing RoE. Given that equipment reliability is influenced by numerous factors, these technologies come with various constraints, multiple outputs, and inputs. Compared to mathematical programming and analytical models, simulation methods in the field of reliability are relatively limited. However, system dynamics (SD) modeling is well-suited to capture dynamics and complexity of systems, making it a valuable tool for long-term strategic decision-making. In this study, a combination of SD and regression approaches has been employed to explore the relationship between reliability and key variables such as HE and profit. Initially, the variables influencing reliability are identified, and then SD is utilized to understand the processes and interactions among these variables. Furthermore, linear regression is employed to establish the relationship between affective variables, reliability, and HE. To validate the results obtained from the proposed method, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Simulation results indicate that implementing policies such as employee training and preventive maintenance significantly enhances RoE, leading to increased sales and profits for the organization. Therefore, managers should prioritize these variables and allocate adequate attention and resources to them. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sustainability is a major driving force in today's society as it serves as a guiding principle in decision-making towards a better and sustainable future. In practice, the concept of sustainability has been concretised through the development of the three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental, and economic. It is commonly acknowledged that the social pillar is the least developed and that the pillar needs more streamlined and applicable definitions, frameworks and approaches. Within the building and construction industry, the sustainability of buildings is typically assessed based on building certification systems. The aim of this article is to compare the definitions and approaches to social sustainability in the existing academic literature and prevailing social sustainability-focused building certification systems (i.e., BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, and WELL). This is done through a systematic review of the academic literature using the PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-framework and an in-depth investigation of the assessment criteria in the building certification systems, focusing on the values assessed rather than benchmark values and assessment methods. The paper concludes that while there is no commonly agreed-upon definition or approach to social sustainability, there is a consensus in parts of the academic literature that social sustainability has an overarching perspective that is comparable to an absolute concept. This absolute approach is not present in the certification systems, so they neither ensure nor improve overarching social sustainability. Instead, they are designed to improve selected social values and contribute to social sustainability by focusing on specific and concretised social values. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The looming global crisis over increasing greenhouse gases and rapid depletion of fossil fuels are the motivation factors for researchers to search for alternative fuels. There is a need for more sustainable and less polluting fuels for internal combustion engines. Biomass offers significant potential as a feed material for gasification to produce gaseous fuel. It is carbon neutral, versatile, and abundant on earth. The present study thus explores a mix of different feedstocks, such as mahua wood and low-grade coal for downdraft gasifiers. The resultant producer gas (PG), after cooling-cleaning will be used as the gaseous fuel to run the diesel engine in dual-fuel mode, while a tiny quantity of linseed biodiesel-diesel blends as B20 (20 % biodiesel + 80 % diesel) will be supplied as injected pilot fuel. The data from experimental work at different engine operation settings was employed to develop a prediction-optimization model using a twin approach of RSM and Grey wolf optimization (GWO). The three control factors for the engine were compression ratio (CR) 17 – 17.5 – 18, equivalence ratio 0.12–0.41, and engine loads in the range of 10–100 % were used to collect data on response variables i.e., brake-thermal efficiency (BTE) and emission data (CO2, NOx, UHC, and CO). A comparative approach of RSM and GWO was utilized for the multi-objective optimization revealing the best results were attained at 17.65 CR, 0.4 ER, 82.55 % engine load in the case of GWO. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Transportation and power generation have historically relied upon Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs). However, because of environmental impact and inefficiency, considerable research has been devoted to improving their performance. Alternative fuels are necessary because of environmental concerns and the depletion of non-renewable fuel stocks. Biodiesel has the potential to reduce emissions and improve sustainability when compared to diesel fuel. Several researchers have examined using nanofluids to increase biodiesel performance in internal combustion engines. Due to their thermal and physical properties, nanoparticles in a host fluid improve engine combustion and efficiency. This comprehensive review examines three key areas for improving ICE efficiency: biodiesel as an alternative fuel, application of nanofluids, and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) integration. The integration of AI/ML in nanoparticle-infused biodiesel offers exciting possibilities for optimizing production processes, enhancing fuel properties, and improving engine performance. This article first discusses, the benefits of biodiesel concerning the environment and various difficulties associated with its usage. The review then explores the effects and characteristics of nanofluids in IC engines, aiming to know their impact on engine emissions and performance. After that, this review discusses the utilization of AI/ML techniques in enhancing the biodiesel-nanofluid combustion process. This article sheds light on the ongoing efforts to make ICE technology more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient by examining current research and emerging patterns in these fields. Finally, the review presents the challenges and future perspectives of the field, paving the way for future research and improvement. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) with renewable energy sources, including biomass, biofuels, engines, and solar power, can revolutionize the energy industry. Biomass and biofuels have benefited significantly from implementing AI and ML algorithms that optimize feedstock, enhance resource management, and facilitate biofuel production. By applying insight derived from data analysis, stakeholders can improve the entire biofuel supply chain-including biomass conversion, fuel synthesis, agricultural growth, and harvesting-to mitigate environmental impacts and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Furthermore, implementing AI and ML in combustion systems and engines has yielded substantial improvements in fuel efficiency, emissions reduction, and overall performance. Enhancing engine design and control techniques with ML algorithms produces cleaner, more efficient engines with minimal environmental impact. This contributes to the sustainability of power generation and transportation. ML algorithms are employed in solar energy to analyze vast quantities of solar data to improve photovoltaic systems' design, operation, and maintenance. The ultimate goal is to increase energy output and system efficiency. Collaboration among academia, industry, and policymakers is imperative to expedite the transition to a sustainable energy future and harness the potential of AI and ML in renewable energy. By implementing these technologies, it is possible to establish a more sustainable energy ecosystem, which would benefit future generations. © 2024, Politeknik Negeri Padang. All rights reserved.},

Modern desalination methods rely heavily on using artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. This paper proposes a novel and optimal approach using neural networks to predict the effectiveness of a hybrid solar-powered desalination system. The experimental design furnishes the requisite data for conducting the analysis. The appropriate features are then retrieved and chosen using the VGG-16 approach. Therefore, it is suggested to use the reptile search optimization with radial basis long short-term memory (RSO-RBLSTM) approach to forecast how well the hybrid solar-powered desalination process would work. Using the RSO method, the hyperparameters of the suggested algorithm are tuned. This study's implementation makes use of the MATLAB programming language. The simulation results are verified using many traditional techniques using various metrics, including RMSE, MAE, MSE, R2, and AARD. The proposed approach has attained 0.05 RMSE, 0.023 MSE, 0.06 MAE, and 4.5 % AARD for the training set. The proposed method has achieved 0.056 RMSE, 0.01 MSE, 0.025 MAE, and 4.2 % AARD for the testing set. The metrics value displays the hybrid desalination system's effective performance when powered by the solar system. © 2023},

According to Industry 5.0-based solution methodologies, sustainable development challenges (SDCs) can be addressed in the renewable energy supply chain (solar energy). This study provides a distinct set of 23 SDCs and 19 Industry 5.0 advantages. Moreover, A hybrid fuzzy best worst method and fuzzy weighted aggregated sum product assessment technique are utilized in the renewable energy supply chain context. To determine the weight of SDCs, preliminary data are gathered based on experts' opinions. The outcomes indicate that the most significant SDCs in the renewable energy supply chain are “non-consideration of human factors,” “Inadequate regulation and implementation of environmental standards,” “Commitment of inadequate management for adopting sustainability,” “non-uniform alignment of sustainability, organization,” and “goal and customer expectation.” For overcoming the SDCs, “supply chain modularity,” “research and innovation in social and human problems,” and “building safer and more complicated hyper-connected networks” are the most prominent Industry 5.0 advantages. The study findings will give the most critical advantages for creating sustainability in the continued industry expansion–society engagement and more sustainable renewable energy supply chain, as well as creating a more resilient energy industry and society. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Theoretical framework: A biodiesel fuel is made from long-chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oil or animal fat. Similarities between physical-chemical characteristics of diesel and biodiesel make their mixture feasible. Environmental benefits achieved by using biofuels to drive machines has increased their contribution in energetic matrixes. Objective: The aim of this research is to produce soybean and sunflower biodiesel in the laboratory using a transesterification reaction and to examine the biodiesel specifications for utilization in compression ignition engines. Method: The physical-chemical properties of the biodiesel measured in the present work are density, viscosity, cetane index, flash point, pour point, and cloud point. Results and conclusion: For soybean and sunflower biodiesel, density (867 kg/m3, 860 kg/m3), viscosity (5.29 mm2/s, 5.30 mm2/s), Centane index (53.88, 55.66), flash point (187°C and 135.6°C) are reported respectively. Regarding the pour point, cloud point, were only determined for sunflower biodiesel, respectively, - 2°C and 13°C. The results indicate that these properties, density, kinematic viscosity, flash point, as determined from the soybean and sunflower biodiesel are within the limits established by The Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, Resolution No. 45 of the ANP of 08/25/2014 – DOU 08/26/2014. These values are, respectively, 850-900 kg/m3, 3-6 mm2/s, at least 100°C.The produced biodiesel presented behavior similar to diesel S10 proving its viability of use. Research implications: As a result of such thorough research, we are able to compare many characteristics of soybean and sunflower biodiesel with commercial diesel S10. This research is critical to the performance evaluation of a compression ignition engine and the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with conventional diesel. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

	abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) is a promising solution to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors to mitigate climate change. An integrated assessment of technological options is required for the effective deployment of CCUS large-scale infrastructure between CO2 production and utilization/sequestration nodes. However, developing cost-effective strategies from engineering and operation perspectives to implement CCUS is challenging. This is due to the diversity of upstream emitting processes located in different geographical areas, available downstream utilization technologies, storage sites capacity/location, and current/future energy/emissions/economic conditions. This paper identifies the need to achieve a robust hybrid assessment tool for CCUS modeling, simulation, and optimization based mainly on artificial intelligence (AI) combined with mechanistic methods. Thus, a critical literature review is conducted to assess CCUS technologies and their related process modeling/simulation/optimization techniques, while evaluating the needs for improvements or new developments to reduce overall CCUS systems design and operation costs. These techniques include first principles- based and data-driven ones, i.e. AI and related machine learning (ML) methods. Besides, the paper gives an overview on the role of life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate CCUS systems where the combined LCA-AI approach is assessed. Other advanced methods based on the AI/ML capabilities/algorithms can be developed to optimize the whole CCUS value chain. Interpretable ML combined with explainable AI can accelerate optimum materials selection by giving strong rules which accelerates the design of capture/utilization plants afterwards. Besides, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) coupled with process simulations will accelerate process design/operation optimization through considering simultaneous optimization of equipment sizing and operating conditions. Moreover, generative deep learning (GDL) is a key solution to optimum capture/utilization materials design/discovery. The developed AI methods can be generalizable where the extracted knowledge can be transferred to future works to help cutting the costs of CCUS value chain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The palm oil industry is one of the most competitive industries and must comply with industry standards for flexible supply chain operations, productivity, and sustainability. Many researchers have demonstrated that Industry 4.0 technologies in a circular economy and sustainability practices (I4.0-in-a-CE-and-SPs) present promising future research opportunities, particularly for an industry with sustainability challenges. Hence, determining the most sustainable I4.0-in-a-CE-and-SPs application is critical for the palm oil industry. However, this process is deemed as a multiple attributes decision-making (MADM) problem due to the presence of three issues, namely, multiple sustainability performance attributes, uncertainty of the attribute's importance level, and data variation. Therefore, an MADM solution is necessary to address these issues. This study extended the fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) method with an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy rough set (IVPFRS) and integrated it with the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) method to rank I4.0-in-a-CE-and-SP applications. The research method starts with the creation of a decision matrix (DM) based on the intersection of 26 I4.0-in-a-CE-and-SPs applications and 14 sustainability performance attributes. The IVPFRS–FWZIC method is subsequently developed to determine the weights of the sustainability performance attributes. The EDAS method uses these weights and the constructed DM to rank I4.0-in-a-CE-and-SPs applications. The robustness of the proposed methods was evaluated using sensitivity analysis, the Spearman's correlation coefficient test, and comparison analysis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To face the impact of climate change in all dimensions of our society in the near future, the European Union (EU) has established an ambitious target. Until 2050, the share of renewable power shall increase up to 75% of all power injected into nowadays’ power grids. While being clean and having become significantly cheaper, renewable energy sources (RES) still present an important disadvantage compared to conventional sources. They show strong fluctuations, which introduce significant uncertainties when predicting the global power outcome and confound the causes and mechanisms underlying the phenomena in the grid, such as blackouts, extreme events, and amplitude death. To properly understand the nature of these fluctuations and model them is one of the key challenges in future energy research worldwide. This review collects some of the most important and recent approaches to model and assess the behavior of power grids driven by renewable energy sources. The goal of this survey is to draw a map to facilitate the different stakeholders and power grid researchers to navigate through some of the most recent advances in this field. We present some of the main research questions underlying power grid functioning and monitoring, as well as the main modeling approaches. These models can be classified as AI- or mathematically inspired models and include dynamical systems, Bayesian inference, stochastic differential equations, machine learning methods, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and reservoir computing. The content is aimed at the broad audience potentially interested in this topic, including academic researchers, engineers, public policy, and decision-makers. Additionally, we also provide an overview of the main repositories and open sources of power grid data and related data sets, including wind speed measurements and other geophysical data. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The transformation to a resource-circular bio-economy offers a mechanism to mitigate climate change and environmental degradation. As advanced bioeconomy components, biorenewables derived from terrestrial, aquatic biomass and waste resources are expected to play significant roles over the next decades. This study provides an overview of potential biomass resources ranging from higher plant species to phototrophic microbial cluster, and their fundamental photosynthesis processes as well as biogeochemical carbon cycles involved in ecosystems. The review reflects empirical advances in conversion technologies and processes to manufacture value-added biorenewables from biomass and waste resources. The nexus perspective of resource-biorenewable-waste has been analysed to understand their interdependency and wider interaction with environmental resources and ecosystems. We further discussed the systems perspectives of biorenewables to develop fundamental understanding of resource flows and carbon cycles across biorenewable subsystems and highlight their spatial and temporal variability. Our in-depth review suggested the system challenges of biorenewable, which are subject to nonlinearity, variability and complexity. To unlock such system complexity and address the challenges, a whole systems approach is necessary to develop fundamental understanding, design novel biorenewable solutions. Our review reflects recent advances and prospects of computational methods for biorenewable systems modelling. This covers the development and applications of first principle models, process design, quantitative evaluation of sustainability and ecosystem services and mathematical optimisation to improve design, operation and planning of processes and develop emerging biorenewable systems. Coupling these advanced computational methods, a whole systems approach enables a multi-scale modelling framework to inherently link the processes and subsystems involved in biomass ecosystems and biorenewable manufacturing. Reviewing modelling advances, our study provides insights into the emerging opportunities in biorenewable research and highlights the frontier research directions, which have the potential to impact biorenewable sector sustainability. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The escalating challenge of water scarcity, intensified by water-energy interdependency, demands an urgent shift towards sustainable solutions. As this concern heightens, the focus on water-energy-infrastructure-human nexus (WEIHN) becomes pivotal to achieving sustainable and resilient water management strategies. In the context of rapid urbanization and population growth, decentralized water systems (DWS) have emerged as a promising alternative to centralized water systems (CWS), offering cost-effective and environmentally sustainable solutions tailored to local water needs and demands. However, a comprehensive and integrative analysis of the economic, social, and environmental impacts needs to be considered before the implementation of DWS in WEIHN. Therefore, analyzing WEIHN at a cross-sectoral level and exploring the roles of infrastructure and humans can provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with DWS development. This review provides a forward-looking roadmap that highlights the critical roles of the infrastructure and human perspectives in WEIHN. First, we identify roadblocks in the CWS and then point out the targeted areas supporting DWS. Second, we investigate the current capability and limitation of infrastructure spatial configuration, safety-related metrics, and interdependency in WEIHN. Third, we emphasize the significance of various human roles, including end-users, operators, and decision-makers in WEIHN. Finally, based on the review findings in water, energy, infrastructure, and human dimensions, we conduct a comprehensive in-depth analysis of innovative technologies (e.g., sensor fusion, digital water infrastructure) and effective management policies. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The Hunger Games Search (HGS) is an innovative optimizer that operates without relying on gradients and utilizes a population-based approach. It draws inspiration from the collaborative foraging activities observed in social animals in their natural habitats. However, despite its notable strengths, HGS is subject to limitations, including inadequate diversity, premature convergence, and susceptibility to local optima. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces two adjusted strategies to enhance the original HGS algorithm. The first adaptive strategy combines the Logarithmic Spiral (LS) technique with Opposition-based Learning (OBL), resulting in the LS-OBL approach. This strategy plays a pivotal role in reducing the search space and maintaining population diversity within HGS, effectively augmenting the algorithm’s exploration capabilities. The second adaptive strategy, the dynamic Rosenbrock Method (RM), contributes to HGS by adjusting the search direction and step size. This adjustment enables HGS to escape from suboptimal solutions and enhances its convergence accuracy. Combined, these two strategies form the improved algorithm proposed in this study, referred to as RLHGS. To assess the efficacy of the introduced strategies, specific experiments are designed to evaluate the impact of LS-OBL and RM on enhancing HGS performance. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate that integrating these two strategies significantly enhances the capabilities of HGS. Furthermore, RLHGS is compared against eight state-of-the-art algorithms using 23 well-established benchmark functions and the CEC2020 test suite. The experimental results consistently indicate that RLHGS outperforms the other algorithms, securing the top rank in both test suites. This compelling evidence substantiates the superior functionality and performance of RLHGS compared to its counterparts. Moreover, RLHGS is applied to address four constrained real-world engineering optimization problems. The final results underscore the effectiveness of RLHGS in tackling such problems, further supporting its value as an efficient optimization method. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biofuel supply chains (BSCs) face diverse uncertainties that pose serious challenges. This has led to an expanding body of research focused on studying these challenges. Hence, there is a growing need for a comprehensive review that summarizes the current studies, identifies their limitations, and provides essential advancements to support scholars in the field. To overcome these limitations, this research aims to provide insights into managing uncertainties in BSCs. The review utilizes the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method, identifying 205 papers for analysis. This study encompasses three key tasks: first, it analyses the general information of the shortlisted papers. Second, it discusses existing methodologies and their limitations in addressing uncertainties. Lastly, it identifies critical research gaps and potential future directions. One notable gap involves the underutilization of machine learning techniques, which show potential for risk identification, resilient planning, demand prediction, and parameter estimations in BSCs but have received limited attention. Another area for investigation is the potential of agent-based simulation, which can contribute to analysing resilient policies, evaluating resilience, predicting parameters, and assessing the impact of emerging technologies on BSC resilience in the twenty-first century. Additionally, the study identifies the omission of various realistic assumptions, such as backward flow, lateral transshipments, and ripple effects in BSC. This study highlights the complexity of managing uncertainties in BSCs and emphasizes the need for further research and attention. It contributes to policymakers’ understanding of uncertain sources and suitable approaches while inspiring researchers to address limitations and generate breakthrough ideas in managing BSC uncertainties. © 2023, The Author(s).},

However, research gaps in comprehensive benchmarks, real-world model evaluations, and data generation tailored to the renewable domain persist. This study explores applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to secure renewable supply chains, drawing insights from over 300 publications. We aim to provide an updated, rigorous analysis of deep learning applications in this field to guide future research. We systematically review literature spanning 2020-2023, retrieving relevant articles from major databases. We examine deep learning's role in intrusion/anomaly detection, supply chain cyberattack detection frameworks, security standards, historical attack analysis, data management strategies, model architectures, and supply chain cyber datasets. Our analysis demonstrates deep learning enables renewable supply chain anomaly detection by processing massively distributed data. We highlight crucial model design factors, including accuracy, adaptation capability, communication security, and resilience to adversarial threats. Comparing 18 major historical attacks informs risk analysis. We also showcase potential deep learning architectures, evaluating their relative strengths and limitations in security applications. Moreover, our review emphasizes best practices for renewable data curation, considering quality, labeling, access efficiency, and governance. Effective deep learning integration necessitates tailored benchmarks, model tuning guidance, and renewable energy data generation. Our multi-dimensional analysis motivates focused efforts on enhancing detection explanations, securing communications, continually retraining models, and establishing standardized assessment protocols.

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) are sustainable solutions for rural zone electrification that use local renewable resources. However, only careful planning at the start of an MG project can ensure its future optimal operation. In this paper, a novel methodology for MG planning by using the uncertainty characterization of renewable resources and demand is presented. Additionally, a model of electricity consumption is proposed and applied in an isolated rural community. In such communities, consumption patterns typically need to be derived as model inputs because consumption measurements are not available for the planning stage. To obtain these inputs, clustering algorithms based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) and fuzzy c-means are used to classify the families of the community given sociodemographic information obtained via surveys. Subsequently, Markov chains (MCs) are employed to generate consumption patterns based on consumption measurements in some dwellings and surveys applied to the community. The nonlinearities and uncertainties associated with renewable resources and consumption are modeled by using prediction interval (PI) models. These PI models provide the required consumption and generation scenarios for deriving the optimal sizing and topological information to address the MG planning problem. The results of the robust planning approach based on scenarios are useful at the feasibility and design phases of an MG project. The proposed methodology is successfully applied to MG planning for a rural Mapuche community, where a conservative criterion was considered to minimize the investment risk. This criterion corresponds to the worst-case scenario in which the demand increases by 19.9% compared to that of the baseline scenario and a lower energy cost is obtained. However, the net present cost and operational costs increase by 14% and 11.75% compared to those of the baseline scenario, respectively. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Reliable runoff prediction plays a significant role in reservoir scheduling, water resources management, and efficient utilization of water resources. To effectively enhance the prediction accuracy of monthly runoff series, a hybrid prediction model (TVF-EMD-SSA-ELM) combining time varying filtering (TVF) based empirical mode decomposition (EMD), salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. Firstly, the monthly runoff series is decomposed into several sub-series using TVF-EMD. Secondly, SSA is used to optimize the input weights and hidden layer biases of the selected ELM model. Finally, the prediction results are generated by summing and reconstructing each sub-series based on the SSA optimized ELM model. This hybrid model is applied to the monthly runoff prediction of Manwan hydropower, Hongjiadu hydropower, and Yingluoxia hydrological station, and compared with back propagation (BP), ELM, SSA-ELM, PSO-ELM, GSA-ELM, TVF-EMD-ELM, EMD-SSA-ELM, extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD)-SSA-ELM, wavelet decomposition (WD)-SSA-ELM and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN)-SSA-ELM models. The prediction performance of various models is reflected by four evaluation indicators (R, NSEC, NRMSE, MAPE). Results reveal that the prediction effect of the ELM model is better than that of BP, the optimization accuracy of SSA is better than those of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and the prediction accuracy of the hybrid TVF-EMD and SSA is better than that of only TVF-EMD or SSA. TVF-EMD-SSA-ELM model has the highest prediction accuracy. When compared with the single ELM model, it's NRMSE and MAPE at Manwan hydropower decrease by 84.4% and 72.38%, those of Hongjiadu hydropower decrease by 85.21% and 78.38%, and those of Yingluoxi hydrological station decrease by 68.42% and 39.51%, respectively. R and NSEC of the three sites are close to 1. Therefore, the proposed model provides a new method for the prediction of monthly runoff, and the results can provide a reference for the prediction of monthly runoff in the study area. © 2023},

	abstract = {Global plastics production has doubled since the beginning of 21st century. Efficient technology is called for plastics waste valorization. The current review provides an overview of the main waste plastic chemical upcycling technologies to produce value-added products. Various technologies including gasification and pyrolysis are under reviewed. However, several review literatures have paid attention to the details and experimental progress in these chemical upcycling techniques. In this review, we attempt to conclude the progress in a multi-scale systems-by-systems perspective. After a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art chemical upcycling techniques, larger-scale process synthesis, assessment, and optimization methodologies to address the sustainability and environmental issues are summarized. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment are selected as two powerful tools for process assessment. Three particular application scenarios of optimization methodologies including experimental design, process synthesis and supply chain management are consequently introduced. Very little work on review articles have summarized the plastic waste-to-wealth process in the systems engineering perspective. Review results show that (1) gasification and pyrolysis offer promising avenues for the conversion of plastic waste into valuable products. These technologies can be integrated with other subsystems to enhance the economic and environmental performance of the overall system. (2) Response surface methodology is commonly used in experimental design and parameter optimization. It allows researchers to systematically investigate the effects of various parameters and optimize process conditions to maximize desired outputs. (3) Superstructure optimization frameworks are valuable tools for process synthesis and pathway selection in plastic waste conversion. However, the potential superstructure is pre-defined. (4) Green supply chain and multi-objective supply chain frameworks can be applied to the design of plastic waste recycling networks, taking into account both economic and environmental considerations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

While existing surveys explore ML applications in EVs, they often need to address ML approaches for SoC and SoH estimation. This paper bridges this gap by comprehensively reviewing how ML is utilized for SoC and SoH estimation, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses across different battery chemistries. Our review offers a systematic breakdown of critical areas: fundamental concepts and functionalities of prominent ML techniques for estimating SoC and SoH, a comparative evaluation of ML techniques applied to diverse EV battery types, an exploration of SoC and SoH estimation using modeling approaches within EV battery systems, and the critical role of dataset quality and model evaluation criteria. Moreover, this paper addresses ML tools developed for lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), image processing applications in EV batteries, and an in-depth investigation of the system model for ML-based SoH and SoC estimation. Furthermore, we present key concepts and methods for SoH and SoC estimation utilizing ML, compare input features, metrics, hyperparameters, and datasets, and demonstrate ML-based system models for EV battery estimation. By conducting this thorough analysis, we aim to close the existing gap and stimulate future progress in ML for SoH and SoC estimation, primarily focusing on LiBs across different EV applications.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The global climate crisis is escalating, and urban living Space (ULS) is a significant contributor to carbon emissions. How to improve the carbon suitability of ULS while promoting social and economic development is a global issue. This study aims to develop an evaluation system for comparing and analyzing carbon suitability inequality and spatial differences in different areas. To achieve this goal, an urban living space carbon suitability index (ULS-CSI) based on spatial organizational index (SOI) has been proposed. The ULS-CSI was calculated at the area scale in Tianjin using information from the Tianjin Land Use Database in 2021. The carbon emissions coefficient method was used to calculate the urban living space carbon emissions (ULSCE). Moran’I and LISA analysis were used to quantify the spatial differences of ULS-CSI. The results showed that the residential living area (RLA) carbon emissions was the highest at the area scale, with carbon emissions of 1.14 × 1011 kg, accounting for 33.74%. The green space leisure area (GLA) carbon absorption was the highest at the area scale, with carbon absorption of 5.76 × 105 kg, accounting for 32.33%. SOI in different areas have spatial heterogeneity as the SOI such as building area, road network density and land use characteristics are significantly different in different areas. Areas with superior CSI were primarily situated in Heping, Hexi, Nankai, and Beichen, accounting for 83.90%. Conversely, areas under the basic CSI threshold included Xiqing, Jinnan, and Dongli, accounting for 16.10%. Spatial characteristics of ULS-CSI in Tianjin portrayed a significant spatial positive correlation, indicating the highest autocorrelation degree of CSI at 500 m, with a Moran ’I value of 0.1733. Although these findings reflect the spatial characteristics of ULS-CSI and the SOI affecting the ULS-CSI at area scale, more perfect data are needed to reflect the complexity of structural factors affecting ULS-CSI at area scale. This study is helpful for urban planning to develop differentiated carbon reduction strategies and promote low-carbon and healthy urban development. Copyright © 2024 Yin, Zhang, Chen and Liao.},

Nevertheless, a lack of extensive investigation on their integration along with quantitative procedures, for example, statistical techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), has emerged. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate the extent to which these methodologies have been connected so far in order to achieve objectives concerning the assessment of sustainability. The scope of the study was restricted to articles published in peer-reviewed journals throughout the period from 1960 to 2022. The investigation was conducted by using a broad set of keywords, encompassing both life cycle methods, including Life Cycle Assessment, Environmental Life Cycle Costing and Emergy Accounting, and quantitative methods, such as mathematical methods, economic methods and building information modeling methods. A total of 144 articles addressing the combined use of life cycle methods and quantitative methodologies for the evaluation of sustainability were identified in the literature review. The greater part of these studies relied on the combined use of LCA with mathematical models, statistical methods and AI methods. As a result, the studies proven that the joint application of such methods can improve consistency of sustainability assessment and enhance CSR. Additionally, many articles suggested novel approaches, including a combined use of LCA and building information modeling as well as simulation methods. The combined use of life cycle methods alongside quantitative methods offers promise in enhancing sustainability assessment by offering more precise and consistent outcomes. However, it becomes imperative to carefully evaluate the hypotheses, accuracy of data, and uncertainty associated with each method within the integration process. Additional research needs to be conducted in order to establish standardized protocols for combining these methodologies as well as to identify the most suitable procedures for their integration with respect to specific objectives concerning sustainability assessment. © 2024 The Author(s).

There is an absence of knowledge of how a SC master plan should be updated to cope with disruptions using hybrid modelling. To fill this gap, we present a hybrid modelling framework to update a SC master plan in presence of disruptions. The proposed framework, which is a precursor to a SC digital twin, integrates simulation, machine learning, and optimisation to identify the production, storage, and distribution values that maximise SC service level while minimising total cost under disruptions. This approach proves effective in a SC disrupted by demand increase and lead time extension. Results show that employing hybrid modelling leads to a noticeable improvement in service level and total cost. The outcome of the new knowledge on using hybrid modelling for managing disruptions provides essential learning for the extension of modelling through a digital twin for SC master planning. We observe that in the presence of disruptions it is more economical to keep higher inventory at downstream SC members than the upstream SC members. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {In recent years, the advent of biosensors and bioelectronics has facilitated the swift and precise detection of numerous biomolecules or pathogens in animal samples, aquatic habitats, and plants. These technologies have emerged as potent assets for the agriculture and aquaculture industries. Many experts have raised the question; how might the integration of biosensors into portable devices or automated monitoring systems enable on-site and real-time detection of diverse biomolecules or pathogens? Agriculture and Aquaculture Applications of Biosensors and Bioelectronics presents the recent developments in biological recognition elements, transducer materials, and signal processing techniques for biosensors and bioelectronics used in agriculture and aquaculture applications. Sophisticated biosensors and bioelectronics operate through the immobilization of biological recognition components-such as enzymes or antibodies-on a transducer surface. This immobilization process allows for the targeted recognition and binding of biomolecules or pathogens. The resulting electrical, optical, or chemical changes triggered by the recognition event are quantifiable through various methods and are often enhanced by applications utilizing artificial intelligence (AI). The necessity for high sensitivity and selectivity, the optimization of biocompatibility and stability, and the integration of biosensors with AI-aided solutions are just some of the challenges and opportunities in developing biosensors for high-tech agriculture and aquaculture. This book focuses on the principles, technologies, applications, opportunities, and challenges of sensors, biosensors, and bioelectronics for agriculture and aquaculture sectors. This book is an excellent resource for the integration of sensors, biosensors, IoT technologies, and drones for overall concepts, principles, models, designs, innovations, developments, and implementation of applications in the high-tech agriculture and farming ecosystem. Agriculture and Aquaculture Applications of Biosensors and Bioelectronics targets a mixed audience of biotechnology engineers, biosensors scientists, bioelectronics researchers, high-tech agriculture analysts, Ph.D. scholars, researchers, academics, professionals, engineers, and students from different communities around the world to share and contribute concepts, methodologies, technologies, approaches, models, frameworks, applications and techniques to resolve the challenging issues associated with the leveraging of the principles and applications of biotechnologies and biosensors with the main areas of artificial intelligence and unmanned aerial vehicle sciences for modeling approaches, simulating molecules of plants, monitoring plants, controlling environment, developing applications, managing supply chain of agriculture and aquaculture in the era of digital transformation revolution. © 2024 by IGI Global.

	abstract = {A well-known method for the environmental impact analysis of the chemical processes, life cycle assessment (LCA) has several limitations to apply to the process design and optimization stages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposed a novel carbon analysis and reduction method at the process level. The proposed LCA-free framework consists of four steps: process simulation, thermodynamic analysis, process-level carbon contribution analysis (PCCA), and carbon optimization. PCCA allows a detailed analysis of the CO2 contribution of each component by mapping exergy information to the CO2 emission. By applying the proposed method to the naphtha cracking center to minimize CO2 emissions, CO2 from utilities can be reduced by 8.72%. Compare to energy optimization, carbon optimization under the PCCA framework shows there is an optimal operating condition that emits less CO2 even though requires more utility duty. The proposed framework has four clear advantages: (i) it can estimate tailored emission factors for target processes at the process level, instead of relying on average values in conventional inventory, (ii) optimize the usage of utilities by type at the process design stage from a carbon perspective, (iii) provide a direction for economic optimization by giving information on the relationship between carbon emissions and energy consumption, and (iv) quantify the reduction in carbon emissions compared to existing processes when designing newly designed carbon reduction processes. Consequently, this study establishes a powerful methodology for the rigorous carbon emission analysis for chemical processes and offers guidelines for carbon reduction at the process level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With the increasing concern for climate change, renewable and sustainable energy production has attracted considerable attention from the scientific community, industrial practitioners, and policy and decision-makers. There are many technological alternatives for each sub-category of complex sustainable energy systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an effective tool to compare the environmental impacts of each pathway and identify the most promising alternatives from an environmental impact perspective. This contribution first reviews the environmental assessment methods and tools developed over the years. Secondly, a comprehensive review of the contribution of the PSE community to the environmental impact analysis of renewable energy systems is performed. It is observed that while LCA is the preferred method, these studies differed widely concerning the choice of impact assessment method used, the level of details shared concerning the underlying LCA calculations, and whether or not sensitivity and uncertainty analyses were carried out, among many others. This makes the comparison of results from different studies difficult and often impossible. It is clear that the PSE community, with its emphasis on systems thinking and holistic approaches, plays a critical role in the design, integration, and operation of complex sustainable energy systems. However, the thorough calculations necessary to ensure a robust and transparent LCA analysis require a shared methodology and a detailed description of the rules. Such explicit, systematic, and transparent methods will set the bar for a minimum requirement for thorough LCA calculations, ensuring fair comparison and discussions of different technical solutions developed in the wider PSE community for sustainable renewables. © 2023},

	abstract = {The global development of supply chains has brought broad prospects to enterprises, but huge supply chain systems are faced with increasing risk of disruption, bringing huge potential risks to enterprises. Nevertheless, due to the unpredictability of these disruptions, the design of resilient supply chains to effectively mitigate disruptions remains an underdeveloped field. Against this background, this paper establishes a novel resilient supply chain design optimization method aimed at enhancing the supply chain’s ability to withstand disruptions. Node disruption impact index (NDII) is introduced and defined to reflect the severity of node disruptions. Risk weight (RW) is defined to represent the degree of supply chain risk, thus avoiding predictions regarding risk scenarios and their probability distributions. RW also highlights the importance enterprises place on supply chain resilience. Based on robust optimization (RO) techniques, we establish an NDII-RO optimization framework that penalizes high-risk nodes. This method is applied to the optimization of a biofuel supply chain in Guangdong province. The optimization results demonstrate that this approach is capable of achieving a resilient supply chain design that can withstand disruptions. © 2024 Materials China. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Modern machine learning (ML) techniques are making inroads in every aspect of renewable energy for optimization and model prediction. The effective utilization of ML techniques for the development and scaling up of renewable energy systems needs a high degree of accountability. However, most of the ML approaches currently in use are termed black box since their work is difficult to comprehend. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an attractive option to solve the issue of poor interoperability in black-box methods. This review investigates the relationship between renewable energy (RE) and XAI. It emphasizes the potential advantages of XAI in improving the performance and efficacy of RE systems. It is realized that although the integration of XAI with RE has enormous potential to alter how energy is produced and consumed, possible hazards and barriers remain to be overcome, particularly concerning transparency, accountability, and fairness. Thus, extensive research is required to address the societal and ethical implications of using XAI in RE and to create standardized data sets and evaluation metrics. In summary, this paper shows the potential, perspectives, opportunities, and challenges of XAI application to RE system management and operation aiming to target the efficient energy-use goals for a more sustainable and trustworthy future. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {Biochar is emerging as a potential solution for biomass conversion to meet the ever increasing demand for sustainable energy. Efficient management systems are needed in order to exploit fully the potential of biochar. Modern machine learning (ML) techniques, and in particular ensemble approaches and explainable AI methods, are valuable for forecasting the properties and efficiency of biochar properly. Machine-learning-based forecasts, optimization, and feature selection are critical for improving biomass management techniques. In this research, we explore the influences of these techniques on the accurate forecasting of biochar yield and properties for a range of biomass sources. We emphasize the importance of the interpretability of a model, as this improves human comprehension and trust in ML predictions. Sensitivity analysis is shown to be an effective technique for finding crucial biomass characteristics that influence the synthesis of biochar. Precision prognostics have far-reaching ramifications, influencing industries such as biomass logistics, conversion technologies, and the successful use of biomass as renewable energy. These advances can make a substantial contribution to a greener future and can encourage the development of a circular biobased economy. This work emphasizes the importance of using sophisticated data-driven methodologies such as ML in biochar synthesis, to usher in ecologically friendly energy solutions.

	abstract = {Drawing upon economic and environmental sustainability, this study explores how developing the operational resilience of the medical supply chain (MSC) contributes to maintaining healthcare in the face of disruption risks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, an optimization-based roadmap is proposed by employing lean tools to achieve and realize MSC resilience. A novel two-stage stochastic optimization model and robust counterpart are developed with the objective of overall cost minimization to cope with the unknowable demand uncertainty represented by scenarios. The reason behind proposing a scenario-based stochastic model is to implement preparedness strategies during the (re)design phase by making strategic and operational level decisions. That being the case, seven cases are generated based on the demand uncertainty intervals along with seven different reliability levels for sensitivity analysis. Computational experiments are conducted through a real case study to compare the centralized and decentralized distribution models in terms of efficiency and responsiveness. The results obtained by the stochastic model and robust counterpart are compared to demonstrate how strong the proposed model is. On top of that, lean tools are used to visualize and analyze the improvement opportunities to contribute to the methodology. By doing so, this paper presents novel theoretical and empirical insights regarding MSC resilience. The computational results emphasize the importance of employing a pre-disruption strategy via the proposed methodology to design a resilient MSC to be prepared for pandemic-related risk. The findings from the sensitivity analysis also verify that regardless of the disruption degree, the developed roadmap with the centralized distribution model leads to up to 40% improvements in terms of the overall cost, order lead time, emission amount, and inventory shortage metrics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Based on the preliminary inquiries, it has been observed that predictive analytics, prominently driven by artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms, assumes a crucial position in energy management across various sectors. This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to gain deeper insights into the progression of AI in energy research from 2003 to 2023. AI models can be used to accurately predict energy consumption, load profiles, and resource planning, ensuring consistent performance and efficient resource utilization. This review article summarizes the existing literature on the implementation of AI in the development of energy management systems. Additionally, it explores the challenges and potential areas of research in applying ANN to energy system management. The study demonstrates that ANN can effectively address integration issues between energy and power systems, such as solar and wind forecasting, power system frequency analysis and control, and transient stability assessment. Based on the comprehensive state-of-the-art study, it can be inferred that the implementation of AI has consistently led to energy reductions exceeding 25%. Furthermore, this article discusses future research directions in this field. © 2024. The Author(s). Published by CBIORE.},

In this article, we propose a linear regression (LR)-based autonomous intelligent optimization method. It first extracts typical features of a constrained multiobjective optimization problem by focused sampling to form a feature vector. Then, a LR model is designed to learn the relationship between optimization problems and intelligent optimization algorithms (IOAs). Finally, the trained model autonomously generates a suitable IOA by inputting the feature vector. The proposed method is applied to six constrained multiobjective benchmark test sets with various characteristics and compared with seven popular optimization algorithms. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method is used to solve the operation optimization problems of an integrated coal mine energy system, and the experimental results show its practicability. © 2020 IEEE.},

The study makes use of state-of-the-art analytical framework based on a unified approach to reveal insights from the present body of knowledge and the potentials for future research developments. Design/methodology/approach: Unlike standard literature reviews, in SLR, a structured approach is followed. The approach enables utilizing contemporary tools and software packages such as R-package “bibliometrix” and Gephi for exploratory and visual analytics. A number of clustering methods are employed to form clusters. Later, multivariate analysis methodologies are adopted to determine the dominant clusters for the influential co-cited references. Findings: Using contemporary tools from Bibliometric Analysis (BA), the authors identify in an exploratory analysis, the influential authors, sources, regions, affiliations and papers. In addition, the use of network analysis tools reveals research clusters, topological analysis, key research topics, interrelation and authors’ collaboration along with their patterns. Finally, the optimum number of clusters computed for cluster analysis is decided using a systematic procedure based on multivariate analysis such as k-means and factor analysis. Originality/value: Modern-day supply chains increasingly depend on developing superior insights from large amounts of data available from diverse sources in unstructured and semi-structured formats. In order to maintain a competitive edge, the supply chains need to perform speedy analysis of big data using efficient tools that provide real-time decision-making insights. Such an analysis necessitates automated processing using intelligent ML algorithms. Through a BA followed by a detailed data visualization in a network analysis enabled grasping key features of the contemporary literature. The analysis is based on 155 documents from the period 2008 to 2018 selected using a systematic selection procedure. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It comprises all activities related to procurement, production, and distribution planning. The proposed multi-objective multi-commodity optimisation model deals with the four conflicting objectives of reducing costs and emissions and choosing top-priority suppliers and the most efficient vehicles. We apply an integrated AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) technique to determine the weights of suppliers, depending on three indices of criteria, alternatives, and raw material. This paper proposes a cross-efficiency evaluation method using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to ensure that the cross-evaluation of different types of vehicles for evaluating peers is as consistent as possible. The mutually contradictory objectives give rise to several Pareto-optimal solutions. The optimal compromise solutions are found using a lexicographic goal programming technique.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to design a sustainable supply chain network in the presence of uncertainty. This network includes suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. In the network, some features, such as different levels of capacity, environmental effects of establishing distribution centers, and number of job opportunities created in the supply chain, are considered. Furthermore, in the case of sustainability, various production technologies and their effects on production speed and emission rates are studied. Various types of vehicles are considered for transportation of the products between the chain members. To model the problem, a bi-level mathematical model with a leader and a follower is introduced. In this chain, the government plays the role of leader and the private sector or industry owner plays the role of follower. The demand is from the parameters whose determination always creates a wide range of uncertainty in the input parameters. Determining the exact value of this parameter has a high computational complexity due to the wide range of customers. To cope with this uncertainty, a robust optimization scheme is adopted. As a result of the inherent uncertainty of the parameters, a realistic approach is developed to deal with the situation. A fuzzy-goal interactive approach is used to solve the proposed model, and its performance is tested using a case study in Iran. The calculation results indicate the appropriateness of the solution method used as well as the necessity to use appropriate uncertainty methods, such as robust planning.

Biogas from agricultural and municipal organic waste is gaining momentum as a renewable energy source. Concurrently, the European Hydrogen Strategy focuses on green hydrogen for decarbonising the industrial and transportation sectors. This paper presents a multi-objective network design model for urban–industrial symbiosis, incorporating anaerobic digestion, cogeneration, photovoltaic, and hydrogen production technologies. Additionally, a Bayesian best-worst method is used to evaluate the weights of the sustainability aspects by decision-makers, integrating these into the mathematical model. The model optimises industrial plant locations considering economic, environmental, and social parameters, including the net present value, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. The model’s functionalities are demonstrated through a real-world case study based in Emilia Romagna, Italy. It is subject to sensitivity analysis to evaluate how changes in the inputs affect the outcomes and highlights feasible trade-offs through the exploration of the (Formula presented.) -constraint. The findings demonstrate that the model substantially boosts energy and hydrogen production. It is not only economically viable but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with fossil fuels and landfilling. Additionally, it contributes to job creation.

	abstract = {With the development of communication infrastructure, the design of supply chains has changed significantly. Blockchain technology, as one of the most cutting-edge technologies, can promote transparency among members of the supply chain network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tries to develop a novel bi-objective optimization model to integrate the transparency resulting from the use of blockchain for designing a three-level supply chain network. The first objective function is to minimize total cost while the second objective function seeks to maximize transparency based on the application of blockchain technology. Moreover, it is worth noting that it is the first attempt to investigate the role of a blockchain model under stochastic conditions. The bi-objectiveness and stochastic nature of the proposed model are then treated using Fuzzy Goal Programming (FGP) and Chance-Constrained programming (CCP) approaches, respectively. To tackle the problem, an improved Branch and Efficiency (B&E) algorithm is developed by incorporating transparency along with cost and service. The impacts of blockchain exclusively through transparency (Case 1) or through transparency, cost, and benefits (Case 2) in Supply Chain Design (SCD) are compared. The results demonstrated that the first case has less computational complexity and better scalability, while the second case has more transparency, less congestion, and more security. As one of the main implications, supply chain managers who are focused on cost minimization as well as transparency maximization are advised to take into account the trade-off between featuring costs and benefits of blockchain technology. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Biowaste is widely studied as one of the potential feedstocks in the biowaste valorization process due to its being abundantly available. In terms of practical implementations, feedstock variability from biowaste, conversion costs and supply chain stability prevent the widespread usage of bioenergy products. Biowaste remediation and valorization have used artificial intelligence (AI), a newly developed idea, to overcome these difficulties. This report analyzed 118 works that applied various AI algorithms to biowaste remediation and valorization-related research published between 2007 and 2022. Four common AI types are utilized in biowaste remediation and valorization: neural networks, Bayesian networks, decision tree, and multivariate regression. The neural network is the most frequent AI for prediction models, the Bayesian network is utilized for probabilistic graphical models, and the decision tree is trusted for providing tools to assist decision-making. Meanwhile, multivariate regression is employed to identify the relationship between experimental variables. AI is a remarkably effective tool in predicting data, which is reportedly better than the conventional approach owing to its characteristics of time-saving and high accuracy. The challenge and future work in biowaste remediation and valorization are briefly discussed to maximize the model's performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, pure economic supply chain management is not commonly contemplated among companies (especially buyers), as recently novel dimensions of supply chains, e.g., environmental, sustainability, and risk, play significant roles. In addition, since companies prefer buying their needs from a group of suppliers, the problem of supplier selection is not solely choosing or qualifying a supplier from among others. Buyers, hence, commonly assemble a portfolio of suppliers by looking at the multi-dimensional pre-determined selection criteria. Since sustainable supplier selection criteria are often assessed by linguistic terms, an appropriate clustering approach is required. This paper presents an innovative way to implement fuzzy equivalence relation to clustering sustainable suppliers through developing a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable supplier selection criteria, including supply chain risk. Fifteen experts participated in this study to evaluate 20 suppliers and cluster them in the plastics industry. Findings reveal that the best partitioning occurs when the suppliers are divided into two clusters, with 4 (20%) and 16 (80%) suppliers, respectively. The four suppliers in cluster one are performing better in terms of the capability of supplier/delivery, service, risk, and sustainability criteria such as environment protection/management, and green innovation. These factors are critical in clustering and selecting sustainable suppliers. The originality of this study lies in developing an all-inclusive set of criteria for clustering sustainable suppliers and adding risk factors to the conventional supplier selection criteria. In addition to partitioning the suppliers and determining the best-performing ones, this study also highlights the most influential factors by analysing the suppliers in the best cluster. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Optimization of crop structure is an efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHGs) from agriculture production. However, carbon footprint have rarely been incorporated into previous planting structure optimization models due to the challenges of assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural carbon footprint for multiple crops in irrigated districts. In addition, previous planting structure models suffered from strong subjectivity in objective function determination, and the obtained non-dominated solution set offered difficulties to decision-makers in selecting specific implementation options. To fill such gaps, an integrated accounting-assessment-optimization-decision making (AAODM) approach was proposed, which remedies the shortcomings of previous crop planting structure optimization models in carbon footprint mitigation, and overcomes the subjectivity of objective function determination and the difficulty in selecting specific implementation options. Firstly, life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to account for the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple crops in the irrigation district. The optimization objective functions of planting structure optimization models can then be determined based on the assessment method of carbon footprint influencing factors. Next, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to generate a non-dominated solution set of the optimization model. The optimal planting structure can be finally obtained based on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean (HM) and knee points (KPs) of the non-dominated solution set. The developed AAODM approach was then applied to a case study of agricultural crop management in Bayan Nur City, China. The results showed that the level of economic development was a key factor influencing the increase in carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City over the past 20 years. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. Moreover, two optimal crop cultivation patterns were provided for decision-makers by selecting solutions from the Pareto front with decision making methods. The comparison results with other methods showed that the solutions obtained by NSGA-II were superior to MOPSO in terms of carbon reduction. The developed AAODM approach for agricultural GHG mitigation could help agricultural production systems in achieving low carbon emissions and high efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Budget allocation across multiple advertising channels involves periodically dividing a fixed total budget among various channels. Yet, the challenge of making sequential decisions to optimize long-term benefits rather than short-term gains is often overlooked. Additionally, more apparent connections must be made between actions taken on one advertising channel and the outcomes on others. Furthermore, budget limitations narrow down the range of potential optimal strategies that can be pursued. In response to these challenges, this study unveils a pioneering multi-channel advertising budget allocation approach that leverages a reinforcement learning (RL) Q-learning framework enriched with an advanced Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to refine the Q-learning methodology. The RL element makes informed sequential decisions, adeptly adjusting strategies to favor long-term rewards by assimilating environmental feedback. Complementing this, the enhanced DE algorithm introduces an inventive clustering-based mutation technique, exploiting key groupings within the DE population to generate novel and practical solutions. The model is further bolstered by a discretization tactic aimed at simplifying the model by streamlining costs. The proposed methodology is rigorously validated using two extensive datasets: the Chinese Internet Company Advertising Dataset (CICAD) and CRITEO-UPLIFT v2, employing metrics like Area Under the Cost Curve (AUCC) and Expected Outcome Metric (EOM) as measures of performance. The empirical results affirm the superiority of the model, showcasing its exceptional performance with significant scores (AUCC = 0.750 and EOM = 0.736 for CICAD; AUCC = 0.813 and EOM = 0.829 for CRITEO-UPLIFT v2), thereby illustrating the model’s proficiency in navigating the multifaceted challenges associated with multi-channel budget allocation and establishing a new benchmark in the field. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the significance of optimizing green supply chain management (GSCM) has gained unprecedented attention from both scholars and industry professionals. This surge in interest has led researchers to employ diverse modeling approaches in the pursuit of enhancing green supply chain networks. In this systematic review, we analyze 159 recent GSCM optimization papers published from 2017 to 2022 and identify the recent trends in mathematical modeling, multi-objective optimization, and the modeling/solver tools utilized. We find that the primary green focus is on minimizing carbon emissions (n = 44), reflecting the increasing concern for environmental sustainability. Among the modeling approaches employed, mixed-integer linear programming has emerged as the most popular choice (n = 51), followed by game theory-based modeling (n = 30). When it comes to multiobjective optimization, the ε-constraint approach is the most widely used. Evolutionary algorithms have emerged as the dominant meta-heuristic optimization approach. Additionally, the widely utilized solver in this domain is CPLEX with the most popular modeling/solver combination being GAMS/CPLEX. Moreover, the Journal of Cleaner Production was the leading outlet for research in this domain (n = 35). In addition to these findings, this study also discusses some other research trends and future research directions. Finally, we discuss the theoretical, managerial, and policy implications of this study. By providing GSCM researchers and practitioners with the latest trends in GSCM optimization approaches, this study contributes to the further advancement of the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In marine vessel operations, fuel costs are major operating costs which affect the overall profitability of the maritime transport industry. The effective enhancement of using ship fuel will increase ship operation efficiency. Since ship fuel consumption depends on different factors, such as weather, cruising condition, cargo load, and engine condition, it is difficult to assess the fuel consumption pattern for various types of ships. Most traditional statistical methods do not consider these factors when predicting marine vessel fuel consumption. With technological development, different statistical models have been developed for estimating fuel consumption patterns based on ship data. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are some of the most effective artificial methods for modelling and validating marine vessel fuel consumption. The application of ANN in maritime transport improves the accuracy of the regression models developed for analysing interactive relationships between various factors. The present review sheds light on consolidating the works carried out in predicting ship fuel consumption using ANN, with an emphasis on topics such as ANN structure, application and prediction algorithms. Future research directions are also proposed and the present review can be a benchmark for mathematical modelling of ship fuel consumption using ANN. © 2023 Van Giao Nguyen et al., published by Sciendo.},

Therefore, this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of MADM methods and their applications for different components of Industry 4.0. A methodology, including a review framework, is provided for the related analyses. The proposed framework includes analyses concerning methods, subtopics, and bibliometry along with the related exploratory tables and figures. Finally, the trends and research gaps are clearly stated to shed light on the further research areas taking into consideration different challenges that can be encountered by researchers, along with a set of propositions to potentially overcome them. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for delivering web services, and includes scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. Due to functional overlap and diversity, web services form a major challenge for selecting adequate services to develop user-provider trust. To address the issue, this study presented a machine learning based trusted model to assist users in selecting trustworthy web services. In the initial stage, using K-Means clustering method the services are selected based on three clusters such as high, medium, and low trust. Next, the trust score is generated by evaluating performance parameters to identify the best services. Experiments conducted with QWS datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach efficiently predicts adequate services with a minimum error rate and high accuracy gain. This technique achieves a 99.32%, 99.36% and 99.48% accuracy rates for the low, medium, and high trust prediction, respectively. The result shows that it is more effective than existing approaches and builds a strong trust relation between users and providers. © 2024 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change, global warming, and the negative consequences of fossil fuels on human life and the environment have prompted governments to seek a long-term replacement for fossil fuels, such as biofuel. According to a few considerations of sustainable supplier selection in the area of constructing biofuel supply chains, import and export activities, financial decisions, and all aspects of sustainability at the same time, this research creates a novel multi-objective model for designing a biofuel supply chain by incorporating financial decisions, sustainability, international suppliers and markets. Supplier selection criteria are weighted using the fuzzy best-worst method, and suppliers are ranked using fuzzy TOPSIS. A possibilistic programming approach based on the Me fuzzy measure is utilized to deal with parameter uncertainties. A fuzzy programming approach is implemented to solve the model. To demonstrate the applicability of the suggested model, an actual case study in Iran is used. The numerical results show that biofuel production and transportation operations account for the bulk of overall costs. Greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of water required contribute significantly to the environmental goal. When compared to deterministic models, profit and social objectives are lower in uncertain models, while order allocation and environmental objectives are higher, but the system will hedge against the high level of uncertainty. In conclusion, the suggested model has a notable impact on improving sustainable facets and can be implemented by governments and legislators. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Examining the game-changing possibilities of explainable machine learning techniques, this study explores the fast-growing area of biochar production prediction. The paper demonstrates how recent advances in sensitivity analysis methodology, optimization of training hyperparameters, and state-of-the-art ensemble techniques have greatly simplified and enhanced the forecasting of biochar output and composition from various biomass sources. The study argues that white-box models, which are more open and comprehensible, are crucial for biochar prediction in light of the increasing suspicion of black-box models. Accurate forecasts are guaranteed by these explainable AI systems, which also give detailed explanations of the mechanisms generating the outcomes. For prediction models to gain confidence and for biochar production processes to enable informed decision-making, there must be an emphasis on interpretability and openness. The paper comprehensively synthesizes the most critical features of biochar prediction by a rigorous assessment of current literature and relies on the authors’ own experience. Explainable machine learning techniques encourage ecologically responsible decision-making by improving forecast accuracy and transparency. Biochar is positioned as a crucial participant in solving global concerns connected to soil health and climate change, and this ultimately contributes to the wider aims of environmental sustainability and renewable energy consumption. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Theoretical works involving new multi-criteria methods and developments of existing methods immediately find applications in areas of business practice. This paper attempts to sort out the areas of application of MCDA methods. For this purpose, the relevant literature from 2018–2023 was reviewed. The inclusion selection criteria were defined as addressing multi-criteria practical issues, open accessibility, comprehensive research methodology and findings, and the use of an MCDA method in the evaluation process. Detailed research identified that the main areas of use of MCDA methods are healthcare, energy management, supplier selection, and transportation. Due to the timeliness and importance of the problem, a detailed study of the use of MCDA methods in sustainability issues was separated. The paper contributes contributions to both theory and economic practice. The article provides a series of recommendations both on the methodological side of the problems to be solved and shows the practical prism of individual decision models, offering ready-to-use decision models, and providing a comprehensive review of recent MCDA advancements, fostering informed and reliable decision-making.

	abstract = {Besides having adverse environmental impacts, power production from conventional sources is severely threatened by uncertainties, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and political conflicts between energy-producing nations. These uncertainties and risks highlight the unsustainability of energy security in conventional power generation systems. Hence, green microgrids are an excellent way to generate carbon-free power to mitigate the risks and decelerate climate change. Compared to conventional sources, green microgrids are less affected by uncertainties such as political decisions and can reduce dependency on foreign energy resources. However, providing sustainable power from clean energy systems faces challenges, including low reliability and high cost. The significant reduction in construction costs and advancements in clean microgrid technology have facilitated the widespread deployment of these systems, enabling them to effectively meet power demand in remote and rural regions. This study aligns with the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, aiming to increase the employment of sustainable and clean power production systems to mitigate climate change and its impacts. The article reviews the disruptions and risks threatening the energy systems’ security and green microgrids. It discusses various methods and tools to estimate the resilience and security of energy systems to give readers a better understanding of the potential risks and disruptions associated with green microgrids. Additionally, the paper identifies the challenges and limitations of transitioning to clean energy systems and presents future directions for improving their security and resilience. It also emphasizes the significance of transitioning to green microgrids to achieve sustainable and clean power while reducing the adverse environmental impacts of using conventional energy sources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Companies need to simultaneously develop capabilities such as responsiveness, resilience, and robustness (Triple-R) to hedge against these risks, while staying competitive. This requires careful investment decisions on which portfolio of Triple-R strategies to create. Being a dynamic, transient phenomena, analytical tools are often not feasible to quantify effects. Computer simulation provides an important alternative, which led to a surge of literature in recent years. This study conducted a systematic literature review of studies that use computer simulation for assessing Triple-R capabilities. Based on a final sample of 174 full articles, we found that classical means to create Triple-R capabilities have been widely assessed for a broad set of different disruption characteristics, including type of disruption and type of propagation. But, while there exists a broad literature that focusses on engineering resilience and adaptation, more research is needed that focusses on resilience as transformation. Recent disruptions are social-ecological disruptions that require new mitigation strategies. To appropriately design and assess these strategies, which need to consider societal impacts towards Industry 5.0, hybrid simulations, online simulations, and physical simulations are required that can model social-ecological aspects and contexts. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Resilient supply chain network design (RSCND) is an important research problem in supply chain management, which means that the supply chain can maintain continuous supply and quickly restore the supply capability in part destruction. Based on the limited distribution information of uncertain demand, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model with ambiguous chance constraint (ACC) is proposed to solve the RSCND problem under demand uncertainty and disruption scenario to provide decision support for planning the supply chain network. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed DRO model, we apply the method to a real case study in Wuhan, China, about designing a resilient RSC network to withstand disruption.

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method that focuses on measuring indicators and making decisions in the environmental dimension. However, its isolation from economic, social, and other dimensions is difficult to identify the interconnections and interactions between multidimensions; its global and static perspectives fail to capture details of spatiotemporal variations effectively. These challenges limit the application of LCA for actual complex systems with multidimensional interweaving and high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This necessitates an approach that can well quantify multidimensional links and spatiotemporal variations to close the gap. To this end, we reviewed approximately 150 papers recorded in Web of Science and Scopus databases to present the progress in the integration of LCA with different dimensions, and the development of dynamic and spatialized LCAs, as well as identify key challenges. Based on the literature review, we introduced the implications of big data (BD) for LCA to explore a theory for the coupling of BD and LCA. We specifically proposed a universal methodological framework of big life cycle analysis (BigLCA), including four practices: (1) building a spatiotemporal reference system to represent the study object, (2) developing a spatiotemporal inventory analysis scheme based on a modified multi-flow and multi-node model to calculate and integrate massive data, (3) introducing and combining a multi-layer indicator system and system dynamics model to quantify multidimensional indicators and identify their links, and (4) providing spatiotemporal contribution analysis and iterative sensitivity analysis schemes for scientific interpretation. The approach and framework can facilitate the understanding and discussions of the use of BD in LCA, which provides a new approach to improve the accuracy of indicator measurement and the effectiveness and applicability of decision-making. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing surge of interest in the application of data analytics (DA) within the realm of supply chain management (SCM), attracting attention from both practitioners and researchers. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of recent implementations of DA in SCM. Employing a systematic literature review (SLR), we conducted a meticulous analysis of over 354 papers. Building upon a prior SLR conducted in 2018, we identify contemporary areas where DA has been applied across various functions within the supply chain and scrutinize the DA models and techniques that have been employed. A comparison between past findings and the current literature reveals a notable upsurge in the utilization of DA across most SCM functions, with a particular emphasis on the prevalence of predictive analytics models in contemporary SCM applications. The findings of this paper offer a detailed insight into the specific DA models and techniques currently in use across various SCM functions. Additionally, a discernible increase in the adoption of mixed or hybrid DA models is observed. However, several research gaps persist, including the need for more attention to real-time DA in SCM, the integration of publicly available data, and the application of DA to mitigate uncertainty in SCM. To address these areas and guide future research endeavors, the paper concludes by delineating six concrete research directions. These directions offer valuable avenues for further exploration in the field. © 2024 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Microalgal biomass is poised to become an important feedstock in the quest to decarbonize the fuels and chemical industries. In this way, it is imperative that researchers prioritize efforts for increased chances of economic viability of the microalgae biomass supply chain. This work applies a sequential techno-economic assessment (TEA) methodology to compare the economic trade-offs between microalgae growth and compositional shift while solving for an alternative economic metric: intrinsic algal biomass value, i.e., the revenue obtained from processing and converting the main components of algae biomass - carbohydrates, lipids, and protein - to a portfolio of products. The framework relies on data derived from small-scale cultivations to initially determine the maximum economic potential of different product portfolios as obtained in multiple biorefining setups. The approach further downselects the number of possible strains to undergo an in-depth TEA in order to quantify the value of transitioning from nutrient-replete to nutrient-deplete cultivations. Among the 13 permutations of strains and cultivation strategies analyzed, this study demonstrated an increase in intrinsic biomass value for four strains after the compositional shift: Chlorella sorokiniana DOE1412, Chlorella sorokiniana DOE1116, Scenedesmus obliquus UTEX393, and Scenedesmus obliquus DOE0152.Z. While product selection is critical in the exploitation of microalgal biomass, the four mentioned strains at least double their intrinsic biomass values, reaching up to $264/ton in net margins above minimum biomass selling prices. This is attainable without considering the production of small market size specialty chemicals, instead targeting markets with scalability potential and/or with currently large sizes. Two other strains, namely Picochlorum celeri WT-CSM/EMRE and Tetraselmis striata LANL1001, should have their biomass productivities increased by around 5 g/m2/day in nutrient-deplete cultivations to achieve economic viability. The concept of implementing an objective comparison between different portfolio configurations detailed herein is an innovative approach towards the economic assessment of microalgae valorization strategies. © 2023},

Through an exhaustive analysis of over 170 studies conducted in the last five years, we focus on the application of machine learning for predicting water quality. The review begins by presenting the latest methodologies for acquiring water quality data. Categorizing machine learning-based predictions for water quality into two primary segments—indicator prediction and water quality index prediction—further distinguishes between single-indicator and multi-indicator predictions. A meticulous examination of each method’s technical details follows. This article explores current cutting-edge research trends in machine learning algorithms, providing a technical perspective on their application in water quality prediction. It investigates the utilization of algorithms in predicting water quality and concludes by highlighting significant challenges and future research directions. Emphasis is placed on key areas such as hydrodynamic water quality coupling, effective data processing and acquisition, and mitigating model uncertainty.

	abstract = {Efficient green energy technologies are essential for sustainable green hydrogen applications. However, economic reasons necessitate bridging technologies between fossil fuels and green hydrogen. Natural gas, the cleanest fossil fuel, can provide non-carbon-containing energy resources, such as hydrogen and ammonia. Ammonia is suitable for economical hydrogen storage and transportation and for direct use as a fuel. In this study, efficient liquefied natural gas (LNG) cold energy utilization and recovery methods developed for producing ammonia are Design 1: energy production in an organic Rankine cycle and Design 2: energy reduction in an air separation unit (ASU). In Design 1, LNG cold energy is converted into power and supplied to the nitrogen compression stage for synthesizing ammonia. In Design 2, LNG cold energy is directly provided to the ASU to reduce the outlet temperature of nitrogen, which is sent to the compression stage, and the compression energy is consequently reduced. Through thermodynamic analysis, the process of LNG cold energy recovery is determined, and the energy consumption in each design is compared. Techno-economic analysis presents the cost reduction in the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA). Compared with the base case, the energy consumption and LCOA in Design 2 are reduced by 11.54 and 23.02%, respectively. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Improper waste management could lead to serious risks to human health and the environment. Thus, improving and optimizing the waste processing network are crucial. Herein, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is presented to design the waste collection network under risk to minimize the total cost and population risk. Herein, the waste types are safe recyclable and hazardous non-recyclable. After collecting and separating the wastes, the safe items are transferred to the recycling centers for processing, and the hazardous wastes are also transshipped to refinery centers for safeguarding using vehicles compatible with waste types. Moving vehicles from the central depot, waste loading from production halls, and transferring wastes to the collection centers are the routing inventory sub-problem. Transferring separated wastes from collection centers to recycling and refinery centers is the transportation sub-problem. In this study, a case study of the automotive industry is applied to the developed optimization model. Due to the network's vulnerability to uncertainty and multiple disturbances, Monte Carlo simulation is employed to generate disruption-oriented independent scenarios, and the k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to reduce scenarios. Also, the two-stage stochastic programming approach is employed to tackle ambiguous parameters using the reduced generated plausible independent scenarios. The NSGA-II algorithm tuned using the Taguchi experiment is adopted to solve the real large-scale problem. The results indicate that using refineries could reduce population risk in waste transfer and processing to an acceptable extent. Observations show a significant conflict and negative dependence between the total cost and population risk associated with waste management.

	abstract = {This study introduces a multi-cycle supply chain design model, encompassing crucial executive decisions confronting supply chain management firms. These decisions encompass facility location, the flow of raw material procurement, and investments indiversifying activities within the power plant's supply chain design. A fuzzy chance-constrained programming approach is employed to deal with the uncertainties associated demand and cost, and a service level indicator is incorporated into the performance metric. The model's validation is conducted on a larger scale, employing two metaheuristic algorithms, MOPSO and NSGAII. The results revealed that the MOPSO algorithm exhibited faster computational efficiency than NSGAII and demonstrated superior performance in the first and second objective functions. However, analytical parameters such as NPF,MSI, and SM favored the NSGAII algorithm over MOPSO. This study presents a comprehensive multi-cycle supply chain design model addressing key management decisions, dealing with demand and cost uncertainty, and evaluating performance using a service level indicator. The study's findings underscore the efficiency of the MOPSO algorithm in computational speed but high light NSGAII's advantages in terms of certain analytical parameters. These insights contribute to enhancing supply chain management strategies in diverse scenarios. © 2024, University of Rijeka. All rights reserved.},

We investigated the contribution of green technologies, economic policy uncertainty (EPU), climate policy uncertainty (CPU), and the role of energy prices in supply chain disruptions. The scope of this study was expanded to assess global supply chain disruptions in the context of recent geopolitical events. The authors employ quantile–quantile regression and Granger causality in quantile analysis using data covering May 2004 to April 2022. This timeframe allows us to understand global supply chain disruptions during recent economic and geopolitical events. Empirical results reveal the strong influence of green technologies, EPU, CPU, and energy prices on the global supply chain, confirming its strong dependence on these factors. In addition, it is evident that CPU is detrimental to the supply chain, hindering the achievement of a renewable/sustainable integrated logistics system. Results also show that macroeconomic uncertainty disrupts the seamless movement of goods and services along the supply chain.

	abstract = {Maximising the content of supplementary cementitious materials as a partial replacement for Portland cement and using recycled concrete aggregates as a full or partial replacement for coarse aggregates are among the widely adopted strategies in the design of green concrete. However, the synergetic implications of adopting both approaches on concrete properties add complexity to the design of green concrete mixes. This paper proposes a novel AI-based multi-objective optimisation framework addressing the lack of a systematic method to formulate these concretes and solves the common multi-objective mix design problems. The framework is developed for the mix proportioning of green concrete mixes containing recycled concrete aggregates and commonly used supplementary cementitious materials while considering the desired compressive strength. The proposed optimisation model leverages a dataset of about 2,120 mixes and employs an extreme gradient boosting machine to model the compressive strength requirements as a mechanical constraint throughout the optimsiation process. Moreover, a set of key environmental objectives, including minimising global warming, acidification, fossil fuel depletion potentials, and the cost of production, are targeted. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through case studies across different strength ranges. The results indicate a significant improvement in environmental sustainability indicators, including a 19.6% and 21.6% reduction in global warming and acidification potentials, besides considerable cost savings of up to 23.7% without compromising the mechanical performance of concrete. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the 21st century, global supply chains have experienced severe risks due to disruptions caused by crises and serious diseases, such as the great tsunami, SARS, and, more recently, COVID-19. Building a resilient supply chain is necessary for business survival and growth. Similarly, there is increasing regulatory and social pressure for managers to continuously design and implement sustainable supply chain networks, encompassing economic, social, and environmental components. Hence, a panacea approach is required to establish a compromise position between resiliency concerns and sustainability responsibilities. To address this, this work presents a hybrid integrated BWM-CoCoSo-multi-objective programming model (BC-MOPM) formulated to deliver a compromise between resilience and sustainability supply chain network design (RS-SCND). First, a thorough literature review analysis is conducted to explore the relationship and correlation between resilience and sustainability to develop a framework for the resiliency and sustainability criteria, in a supply chain context. Second, four objectives were formulated, including the minimisation of total cost and environmental impact and the maximisation of social and resilience paradigms. A real two-tier supply chain network is deployed to evaluate the applicability of the developed BC-MOPM. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is conducted to establish the relative importance of the identified criteria to prove the model's robustness. Results demonstrate the capability of the BC-MOPM in revealing trade-offs between the resiliency and sustainability aspects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

The economic, environmental, and geopolitical regional characteristics of the Pacific region present many challenges and opportunities for building supply chain resilience. This study aims to measure the resilience of supply chains (SCs) considering the characteristics of the network under which they operate. In this study, we proposed a new common set of weights (CSW) model in data envelopment analysis to evaluate the resilience of SCNs. Many external variables beyond decision-makers’ direct control impact SC operations and their resilience. Therefore, the proposed CSW model formulates the non-discretionary and non-controllable inputs in measuring the resilience of SCNs and provides a complete ranking with a higher discrimination power. To improve SCRes, SC managers are recommended to enhance the clustering coefficient and node degree of their SCN by establishing more connections with other SCNs in order to pinpoint the essential capabilities that companies should prioritise in order to develop a stronger and more adaptable SC in the post-COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The utilization of waste biomass-derived producer gas in dual-fuel engines has attracted a lot of interest as a sustainable energy option that encourages waste reduction as well as cleaner energy production. This research proposed a glass-box modeling strategy that combined the robust Huber and Tweedie regression approaches with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to estimate the performance and emissions of the test engine. The research demonstrated robustness over heteroscedasticity by using Huber and Tweedie regression methods, which are critical factors in real-world engine functioning. The Huber method consistently outscored both the LR and Tweedie-based prediction models in a comparison of prediction techniques for various parameters. Huber obtained remarkably high R2 values as 0.941 to 0.984, in addition to quite low root mean squared error. SHAP analysis helped in revealing the degree and direction of individual features’ effect on the model. The engine load was observed to be having the most profound effect on the final model output. This study contributed to the development of waste biomass utilization in dual-fuel engines by providing a reliable prognostic tool for developing and running such systems in sustainable practices. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The study provides insights into the energy requirements, productivity, net return, and environmental impacts of two common cultivation methods, open space and greenhouse. Results show that open space and greenhouse methods require an average input energy of 15920.40 and 17691.60 MJ kg−1, respectively, with energy ratios of 0.89 and 0.80 and productivity energy indexes of 0.06 and 0.02 kg MJ−1, respectively. The net return of open space and greenhouse methods is 204376.59 and 269276.06 ($ kg−1), productivity of 0.17 and 0.16 (kg $−1), respectively. The ReCiPe 2016 method is used to calculate environmental effects, with resource impact categories ranging from 201.11 to 205.68 USD2013. In terms of damage assessment categories, water and machinery and equipment have the highest share of damage assessment in both cultivation methods. DEA shows that total optimal energy consumption in the open space method is 14476.93 (MJ kg−1), resulting in a 7.55% decrease in energy consumption compared to the current cultivation. This is achieved by converting inefficient to efficient cultivation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Purpose: Rising energy demand and the quest for achieving climate change targets have been pushing emerging markets like India to bolster the natural gas share in their energy mix. The country has set an aggressive target of increasing natural gas share in the energy mix to 15% by 2030. The purpose of this study is to acknowledge the need for adopting and developing strategies for natural gas business market development to ensure a reliable supply at an affordable price. Hence, this study explores the natural gas market business development strategies and assesses them through cause/effect analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This study proposed an integrated framework based on the Grey concept and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to assess and determine the interdependence among the natural gas business market development strategies by cause-and-effect group analysis. The application of Grey theory reduced the uncertainty and subjectivity involved in the decision-making process. Later, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the framework. Findings: The natural gas business market development strategies are identified through a systematic literature search and contributions from industry experts. The findings of this study highlight the importance of developing pipeline and storage infrastructure facilities, ensuring supply security through long-term imports and overseas investment, implementing free-market-based pricing, simplification and standardization of regulatory processes at state and national levels, etc., for the development of the natural gas market development in India. Research limitations/implications: This study acknowledges the natural gas market development strategies and evaluated them into cause-and-effect groups which are limited to Indian context. All evaluations in the Grey-based DEMATEL method were made in this study based on the decision team inputs which limits the generalization to other geographies. Moreover, the opinions of the experts can be subjective and differ. The selection of the experts is done through non-probability sampling process. Practical implications: This study could support the government and decision-makers in formulating the appropriate strategies to develop the domestic natural gas market. The cause-and-effect relationships are helpful for the companies, management, government, regulators and other stakeholders to understand the criticality of the causal strategies that must be implemented for developing the favorable natural gas business market scenario. Originality/value: This study explores and evaluates the strategies that successfully bolster the natural gas business demand in India using Grey-based DEMATEL framework. By focusing on those critical strategies, relevant stakeholders would ensure a reliable natural gas supply at affordable prices. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The extensive oil and gas industrial sectors have caused several environmental problems in Iran. This motivated the governments to consider the potential capacity developing renewable energies such as biomass energy as an excellent strategic plan for sustainable sources. However, biomass energy is at the early stage because of multi-dimensional barriers (e.g., social, technical, and policy). Thus, there is a need to assess and evaluate the existing challenges and provide a strategic plan to assist decision-makers, for the country's sustainable biomass energy development. A novel approach is developed in the current study by extending the Interval-valued Spherical fuzzy best–worst method (IVSFS-BWM) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (IVSFS-DEMATEL). n the seven steps methodology, IVSFS-BWM is utilized to derive the optimum importance weights of contributing factors in sustainable challenges of biomass energy. Then, IVSFS-DEMATEL is employed to find causality and interrelationships between the contributing factors. 39 numbers of challenges as influential parameters are taken into account to study the challenges of biomass energy. A comparison with familiar decision-making competitors’ tools has been conducted to show the advantages and robustness of the proposed methodology. The results indicated that the proposed method can adequately deal with subjective uncertainties from decision-making opinions, and the challenge of the contributing factors in biofuel energy as “fear of public health and safety hazards” needs necessary attention to the contributing factors in the system such as “lack of professional training institute,” “lack of infrastructural requirements,” and “lack of investors,” considering the resilience aspects. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis is conducted and by checking all contributing factors, concluded that the system is not fully sensitive to the variation, as it is less partially dependent and reflects the conformity of obtained results as accurately as possible. The outcomes assist decision-makers in providing an effective strategic plan by eliminating the multi-dimensional barriers in sustainable biomass energy development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

However, the transition of the semiconductor industry to secure digital manufacturing has also increased the importance of safeguarding networked assets from cybercriminals. To this end, a flexible scheme is developed in this paper to model wafer fabrication as a directed attack graph. This graph representation is then used as the basis of a two-stage stochastic programming model that considers uncertainty in attack probabilities while minimizing expected cyber risk by employing optimal, budget-constrained countermeasures (i.e., arc interdiction strategies). A sample average approximation coupled with a progressive hedging algorithm or Bender's decomposition are proposed. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the viability of the proposed solution algorithms, the optimal arc interdiction strategies under various budget levels, and the effect of attack probability mappings. The results indicate that computing terminals nearest the manufacturing process have the highest defense priority and that the sample average approximation coupled with a progressive hedging algorithm is a suitable hybrid solution procedure for large instances when compared with sample average approximation coupled with Benders. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Art design is a form of creative expression that encompasses the visual aesthetics and conceptual elements of various mediums. Art design has undergone a transformative evolution with the integration of digital media, reshaping the landscape of creative expression. In contemporary art, artists leverage digital tools and technologies to explore innovative ways of crafting visual narratives. Hence, to improve the quality of the art design this paper constructed a framework of Weighted Genetic Optimization (WGO). The proposed WGO model incorporates the statistical modeling of digital media technology. The statistical technique comprises the estimation of the features in the art design model. Through the integration of WGO with the statistical model features related to the art design with the incorporation of digital media are evaluated. The statistical features in the art design are observed as the digital information such as geometric, GLCM and HUE are the essential features in the integrated WGO with statistical techniques. The estimated features are applied over the deep learning model with the LSTM network for the automated classification of art design that uses digital media for improvement. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed WGO integrated statistical model achieves the HUE value ranges from 0 -360 which is effective for art design modeling. Also, the proposed model achieves a significant classification rate of 0.98 accuracy with a loss value of 0.2 which is ~9% less loss than the conventional techniques. ©2024: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.},

	abstract = {Good building performance is contingent on complex, interacting factors. The application of performance simulation tools allows practitioners to adopt a virtual prototype and test approach in selecting design solutions that balance performance and cost. The aim of this book is to provide guidance on approaches to the modelling and simulation of energy systems in the built environment at various scales and complexities to address the myriad challenges of the clean energy transition. The intention is to equip the reader with the understanding required to compose high integrity models, commission realistic simulations, and interpret predictions to assess life cycle performance and ensure operational resilience. Initial chapters introduce the impressive capabilities of building energy systems simulation and the new features that are likely to be added in future. The authors then describe the sustainable energy challenge and how modelling and simulation can be used to scrutinise proposals in a cost-effectively manner. The remainder of the book then covers different technology options including electrification of heating, net zero energy housing, community energy systems, active demand management, and urban energy action planning. In each case the nature of the problem is described, the construction of a high-fidelity computer model elaborated, and principal simulation outcomes demonstrated. Some of the problem domains addressed in the book are accompanied by a high-fidelity digital model available externally. These models are compatible with the ESP-r performance simulation program, which is freely available under an open-source licence. Applied Building Performance Simulation provides a thorough grounding and practical guidance in the role of software simulation tools for building performance, for an audience of researchers, industry professionals, advanced students, and policy makers, regulators and standards bodies operating in the field. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology and its licensors 2024.

	abstract = {Energy and agriculture are two independent sectors that share a mutual coexistence referred to as the energy-agriculture nexus. In an attempt to facilitate the capacity of this coexistence simultaneously, there is a need for involvement of latest technologies such as the artificial intelligence (AI). This research focused on the incorporation of AI along the energy-agriculture nexus, in an attempt to explore the applications, opportunities, challenges and its potential implications for various stakeholders. According to an intensive literature survey conducted, AI applications were found to be on a significant rise since the last decade, specifically in prediction applications and optimization applications, respectively, focusing on bioenergy (55 %), energy use analysis (17 %), process value chain (6 %), energy-efficient irrigation (6 %), energy in greenhouse (6 %), livestock management (2 %), farm power and machinery (4 %) and risk management (4 %). Challenges observed in the literature were found to be in terms of data availability, data complexity and heterogeneity, computing power, accountability and transparency in decision-making and research focus. In order to fully comprehend the implications of AI integration along the energy-agriculture nexus and to develop strategies and guidelines for maximizing the advantages of this technology while minimizing potential risks and adverse effects on stakeholders, more research and discussions are recommended. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and environmental points are equally important components within the response to local weather change. Therefore, based on the efforts of reducing carbon emissions more efficiently and effectively, this study tries to focus on AI integration with carbon capture technology. The urgency of tackling climate change means we need more advanced carbon capture, and this is an area where AI can make a huge impact in how these technologies are operated and managed. It will minimize manufacturing emissions and improve both resource efficiency as well as our planet's environmental footprint by turning waste into something of value again. Artificial intelligence could be leveraged to analyze huge data sets from carbon capture plants, searching for optimal system settings and more efficient ways of identifying patterns in the available information at a larger scale than currently possible. In addition, AI incorporated sensors and monitoring mechanisms in the supply chain can identify any operational failure at reception itself allowing for timely action to protect those areas. Artificial intelligence also helps generative design for carbon capture materials, which allows researchers to explore new types of carbon-absorbing material, including metal–organic frameworks and polymeric materials that are important in industrial CO2, such as moisture. In addition, it increases the accuracy of reservoir simulations and controls CO2 injection systems for storage or enhanced oil recovery. Through applying AI algorithms on reservoir geology, production performance and real-time data this study would like to facilitate the optimization of injection processes as well as minimize CO2 emissions while assuring a maximum efficiency. Artificial intelligence integrates with renewable-based carbon capture efforts that can be employed by AI-driven smart grid systems to improve carbon capture methods. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {In an industry 4.0 era, manufacturers must make the right decisions concerning reutilizing and recycling returned goods to lower waste by connecting and integrating societal behaviour with industrial practices. Since customers would not buy unsatisfactory goods, managers have to decide whether to reuse or recycle them. Proposing a framework in which consumers involve in supply chain managerial decisions leads to customer-centric reverse logistics by introducing a Decentralized consensus decision-making concept. Moreover, an industry benchmark would aid managers and policymakers. Based on Logistics 4.0, this study developed a framework and used social media data to improve reverse logistics decision-making using artificial intelligence - a deep learning hybrid method that combines convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks. Furthermore, this study shows how to use sentiment analysis algorithms to analyze positive and negative feedback from customers and develop high-efficiency decentralized disposition decision-making techniques for reverse logistic managers. Without the need for human intervention, corporations may use the framework to smart scrutinize their customers' feedback and sentiments to make strategic reverse logistics decisions for reducing returned goods, waste, inventory levels, and costs while increasing productivity, benefits, supply chain sustainability, and customer loyalty, resulting in a more effective movement towards green logistics, a competitive advantage, and increased profits for the corporation. While the framework is flexible enough to be utilized in various fields, including electronics and automobiles, it significantly reduces the risk of biased feedback resulting from not considering a particular language or region. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Operations research (OR) has been at the core of decision making since World War II, and today, business interactions on different platforms have changed business dynamics, introducing a high degree of uncertainty. To have a sustainable vision of their business, firms need to have a suitable decision-making process at each stage, including minute details. Our study reviews and investigates the existing research in the field of decision support systems (DSSs) and how artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have been integrated into OR. The findings of our review show how AI has contributed to decision making in the operations research field. This review presents synergies, differences, and overlaps in AI, DSSs, and OR. Furthermore, a clarification of the literature based on the approaches adopted to develop the DSS is presented along with the underlying theories. The classification has been primarily divided into two categories, i.e. theory building and application-based approaches, along with taxonomies based on the AI, DSS, and OR areas. In this review, past studies were calibrated according to prognostic capability, exploitation of large data sets, number of factors considered, development of learning capability, and validation in the decision-making framework. This paper presents gaps and future research opportunities concerning prediction and learning, decision making and optimization in view of intelligent decision making in today’s era of uncertainty.

	abstract = {The biggest challenge that retailers face in satisfying consumer requirements is to ensure an integrated/seamless shopping experience consistent with the purchase, regardless of how the purchase is made. Giant companies have many depots, points of delivery, retail stores, etc. in different cities. This study focused on modeling vehicle routing in a retail distribution network. Goods may be sold in the distribution system addressed in the research model employing two methods: physical and online sales. This study examined the routing problem in the Omni-Channel (OC) retail system, focusing on a multi-objective approach to increase consumer physical convenience (ease of access) using several delivery techniques from six points of delivery. To this end, the optimization of a distribution network was examined through two objective functions. The first objective function minimized the cost of the distribution network, whereas the second maximized customer convenience in terms of the minimum shipment delivery time from the four positions (retail store, intermediate depot, points of delivery, and city distribution center by considering the demand for each product). Two meta-heuristic algorithms, MOGWO and NSGA-II, were used to solve the problem. The results demonstrate that the two-step approach generates smaller objective function values than the second objective function. In addition, the total costs of the two-stage approach were higher than those predicted by the proposed model. Consequently, it was concluded that, in the proposed mathematical model, owing to the integrated optimization of a distribution system and considering the possibility of direct shipment of products to customers, Pareto points are obtained with a lower cost and higher customer satisfaction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As climate change intensifies and extreme weather events occur more frequently, the uncertainties of demand, production and inventory will affect the operation and management of supply chains. In this paper, a systematic method for evaluating the resilience of the supply chain is proposed, which is applied to the demand side management of an actual downstream oil supply chain. According to the practical operation of the downstream oil supply chain, several scenarios such as disruption of refineries, shutdown of pipelines and increasing demand are defined. Then, two indices are introduced to make a quantitative resilience assessment for the studied downstream oil supply chain. The inventory strategy is also proposed and applied to different scenarios. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation is used to make a comprehensive analysis with multiple scenarios. The results show that increasing the inventory of storage depots can improve the resilience of the supply chain by 2.67% to 14.83%. According to the sensitivity analysis for the failure rate and repair rate of each link, it is indicated that the resilience can be improved by 5.95% when the repair rate is doubled and be reduced to 16.04% when the repair rate is reduced by half. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Distributed generation systems (DGSs) are one of the key developments enabling the energy transition. DGSs provide users with increased control over their energy use and generation, but entail greater complexity in their design and operation. Traditionally, optimization models have been used to overcome this complexity, and currently, research is focusing on integrating uncertainties on them. This review attempts to analyze, classify and discuss 170 articles dealing with optimization of DGSs under uncertainty. A survey has been performed to identify the selected manuscripts and the strengths and weaknesses of previous reviews. As a result, an innovative classification has been designed and the distinct elements of optimization models in DGSs have been highlighted: Microgrid architecture, sources of uncertainty, uncertainty addressing methods, problem types and formulations, objective functions, optimization algorithms and additional features. Each part is detailed thoroughly to provide an instructive overview of the research output in the area. Subsequently, several aspects of interest are discussed in depth: The future of dealing with uncertainty, the main contributions and trends, and the relative importance of the field. It is expected that this review will be of use to both experts and lay people to learn more about the current state of optimization models in DGSs and provide insights into how to further develop this field. © 2022 by the authors.},

In this review work, the main methods and criteria for monitoring CO2 emission from ports and ships are meticulously presented. Advanced renewable energy technologies connected with sources such as solar, wind, tidal, wave, and alternative fuels and their application in ports to reduce CO2 are thoroughly examined. In addition, energy-saving techniques and strategies for alternative power and fuels in ships are comprehensively evaluated. The key finding is that port-to-ship interactions such as using zero-emission energy sources or nearly zero-emission approaches could offer significant benefits for CO2 emission reduction. Finally, it is recommended that smart approaches associated with efficient and clean energy use for the port-to-ship pathways to generate net zero-CO2 emissions for the maritime shipping sector need further urgent investigation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Relays in the distribution network prevent congestion, supply stagnancy, and delayed deliveries. Protecting the relay functions and streamlining them are tedious due to the varying vehicle and goods densities. This article introduces a populous relay management scheme (PRMS) for multi-access in delivery networks to address the problem above. The proposed scheme relies on vehicle and goods movement frequency for improving the relay utilization without congestion. These features are analyzed for the stagnancy and dispatch priority in maximizing the goods delivery. The conventional back propagation network is employed for identifying stagnancy and relay population (congestion) for distributed delivery assignments. The back propagation process identifies the prioritized tasks for preventing delivery delays and reducing congestion through priority segregation. This enhances the least to large-good migration with controlled delay and rapid migration, reducing congestion. © 2022 Ting Yang et al.},

A methodology that integrates machine-learning algorithms with the optimisation process was proposed in order to generate solutions for large-scale supply chain optimisation problems. Models based on artificial neural network (ANN) and Bayesian network were developed by using the knowledge from previously-solved problems, to define good starting points for the search for solutions in the optimisation process. With this novel approach, the search space can be reduced and optimal solutions found with a shorter runtime. The applicability of the proposed approach was evaluated with a case study relating to biomass supply chain planning in the Central Vietnam region.

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of technology in the energy sector and the demand for sustainable energy practices, the world is aiming at fostering the hydrogen economy and developing proper energy management utilizing green hydrogen. To ensure the successful adoption of hydrogen-driven renewable energy systems, a thorough understanding of the degree to which hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) can be optimized whilst meeting commercial and societal goals is critical. The work presented here is comprehensive and geared towards reviewing the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in HRESs, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind energy that are integrated with fuel cells (FCs). Common AI methods such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and artificial neural network are introduced, current FCs technology and market trends are analyzed, FCs control strategies using AI are discussed and recent demonstration HRESs are described. In addition, this review encapsulates vital information on the following (1) technical–economic-environmental optimizations studies on FC-HRES since 2015 (2) implementation of AI in designing robust energy management systems (3) a comprehensive list of studies on optimization of proton exchange membrane FCs and solid oxide FCs (the most addressed in the literature) using different AI methods. While there is considerable research on FCs for mobile applications, blending hydrogen power generating systems into renewable energy systems using advanced computing and AI methods has not been previously discussed. The paper showed the enormous capability of AI-based, and data-driven modeling in identifying the conditions required for maximum power production. The main advantages of AI enabled solutions lie in predicting the drawbacks of HRES during unexpected load peaks as well as intermittent energy production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

A deterministic programming model was formulated for the forest regulation problem, maximizing the number of harvested stands. A Monte Carlo simulation was applied to generate a random seed disturbance. In the tested instances, the number of stands that would have been harvested according to the deterministic schedule but were not harvested, due to delays in the maintenance of segments of the roads, varied from 1 to 400. The timber volume harvested over the planning horizon varied considerably, with periods in which the value was even zero. The stochastic model proposed can be useful to assist managers in decision making. In addition, the approach may help with road classification and reducing risks for better management practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Meeting ecological water requirements (EWRs) is important for maintaining watershed system stability in many arid and semi-arid areas. Rainfall–runoff relationships under changing climate conditions could have many adverse effects on EWRs. The inherent uncertainties in water resource management and potential variations in EWRs should be considered to obtain suitable water allocation strategies under climate change. In this study, an integrated approach was proposed through incorporation of copula functions and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation into a chance-constrained programming (CCP) model. The proposed approach had several advantages for water resource allocation under variable climatic conditions with respect to the following: (a) tackling correlated features of rainfall and watershed inflow under climate change based on copula–MCMC simulations, (b) obtaining runoff distributions using the copula sampling method under multiple climate change scenarios, (c) analyzing fluctuations in EWRs based on variable monthly flows and diverse runoff distributions, and (d) obtaining desired water allocation strategies through the developed CCP model with consideration of EWRs and water shortage risk. Application of the developed method to water resource management in the city of Dalian (China) indicated that the EWRs in the watersheds of Dalian would exhibit large variations under changing climatic conditions. Moreover, in comparison with the supply in 2025, an increase in water supply transferred from the Dahuofang Reservoir (Hun River) would be 6942–33,772, 6942–25,472, and 2849–14,259 Mt with risk tolerance levels of 20%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

Parameters’ selection and control in FFF are of utmost importance since they significantly affect the surface quality (SQ) and dimensional accuracy (DA) of the FFF printed parts. In the present paper, initially, the FFF process is briefly presented. Next, a cause-and-effect diagram exhibits the process parameters’ categorization with the SQ and DA of the manufactured parts. Then, according to the robust design theory, the process parameters are divided into three classes, i.e., the signal, the control, and the noise. This classification supports the selection of appropriate FFF printers, according to the control parameters, whereas it facilitates the optimization of the SQ and DA of printed parts, concerning the signal parameters. Finally, the impact of each parameter on SQ and DA is presented, supported by an extensive literature review. Overall, the process parameters’ optimization is critical for the SQ and DA. Therefore, they should be adjusted to achieve higher quality and less post-processing work. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Supplier selection has received substantial consideration in the literature since it is considered one of the key levers contributing to a firm's success. Selecting the right suppliers for different product items requires an appropriate problem framing and a suitable approach. Despite the vast literature on this topic, there is not a comprehensive framework underlying the supplier selection process that addresses those concerns. This paper formalizes a framework that provides guidance on how supplier selection should be formulated and approached for different types of items segmented in Kraljic's portfolio matrix and production policies. The framework derives from a thorough literature review, which explores the main dimensions in supplier selection, including sourcing strategy, decision scope and environment, selection criteria, and solution approaches. 326 papers, published from 2000 to 2021, were reviewed for said purpose. The results indicate that supplier selection regarding items with a high purchasing importance should lead to holistic selection criteria. In addition, items comprising a high complexity of supply and production activities should require integrated selection and different sources of uncertainty associated with decision scope and environment, respectively, to solve it, as well as hybrid approaches. There are still many research opportunities in the supplier selection area, particularly in the integrated selection problems and hybrid solution methods, as well as in the risk mitigation, sustainability goals, and new technology adoption. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The poultry industry is one of the most important agricultural sectors, which constitutes a significant part of the per capita consumption of protein and meat. Integrating operations of poultry industry sections including production, distribution and consumption becomes vital. Although the proper poultry supply chain has been established and made plenty of benefits for a long time, the global outbreak of COVID-19 shows that operations under pandemic are still challenge for the poultry industry. In this paper, the impacts of pandemic on poultry industry is investigated by developing a multi-period multi-modal stochastic poultry supply chain. Two models are developed aiming to mitigate the negative effects of pandemic occurrence through product stocking policy. In the first model, distribution system is in accordance with a multi-component structure, while the second model allows direct connections between suppliers (farmers) and demanders (customers). In both models, poultry productions are negatively affected by COVID 19. Due to the complexity of the model, a hybrid solution approach based on Branch and Cut and Dynamic Programming is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed model and solution procedure, a case study on the broiler industry in the state of Mississippi is performed. The results show that storing poultry products in the pre-pandemic along with direct logistics during pandemic period can save the broiler supply chain cost up to 30%. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This review organizes the essential basics, major applications, and remaining challenges of machine learning in sustainable energies into two parts to accommodate the background knowledge and interests of both artificial intelligence and sustainable energy experts. First, the major applications of machine learning are divided into prediction, clustering, and optimization. For each category, the literature is categorized from new viewpoints, and research trends are highlighted to focus future research. In the second part, three primary machine learning–driven sustainability areas are introduced with respect to their abundance in the literature: multi-carrier energy systems, spatiotemporal analytics, and circular integration. For each engineering area, the contemporary progress is investigated in terms of a specific future research path. It is anticipated that the rapid application of machine learning tools will speed the development of sustainable energies during the next decade. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, large-scale applications of AI are still limited. One barrier is the lack of quantitative understandings of the potential benefits and risks of different AI applications. This study reviewed relevant AI literature and categorized those case studies by application types, impact categories, and application modes. Most studies assessed the energy, economic, and safety implications of AI applications, while few of them have evaluated the environmental impacts of AI, given the large data gaps and difficulties in choosing appropriate assessment methods. Based on the reviewed case studies in the chemical industry, we proposed a conceptual framework that encompasses approaches from industrial ecology, economics, and engineering to guide the selection of performance indicators and evaluation methods for a holistic assessment of AI's impacts. This framework could be a valuable tool to support the decision-making related to AI in the fundamental research and practical production of chemicals. Although this study focuses on the chemical industry, the insights of the literature review and the proposed framework could be applied to AI applications in other industries and broad industrial ecology fields. In the end, this study highlights future research directions for addressing the data challenges in assessing AI's impacts and developing AI-enhanced tools to support the sustainable development of the chemical industry. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Electric vehicle deployment shows promising potentials in promoting cleaner energy utilization and reducing carbon emission. Due to increasing carbon neutral pressure and market competition from transportation sector, government agencies and public bodies (GAPBs) have emphasized the significance of electric vehicle adoption through supplier selection. Consequently, GAPBs must consider a reasonable criteria system and a comprehensive supplier selection framework and rationally select the electric vehicle supplier that matches their practical needs in terms of economic, social, environmental, and technical factors. This paper provides insights into electric vehicle supplier selection (EVSS) from the perspective of GAPBs using an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework based on best–worst method (BWM) and fuzzy ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). Initially, 14 critical factors from economic, social, environmental, and technical dimensions are identified as the criteria by literature review and experts’ opinions. Then, a comprehensive decision framework using the integrated MCDM approach is proposed. To validate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed framework, a case study is launched and analyzed. It emerges that bad environmental record, cost, quality, service, and environmental initiatives are the most important criteria in EVSS for GAPBs with the weight values of 0.1995, 0.1172, 0.1219, 0.0708, and 0.2553. The comparative analysis and the sensitivity analysis are performed for verifying the reliability of the proposed framework. The work helps to understand the electric vehicle supplier selection criteria and makes methodological decision-making support for GAPBs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study compares the reliability of intelligent and thermodynamic modeling of hydrogen (H2) solubility in two bio-derived compounds (furfuryl alcohol and furfural). The intelligent modeling phase conducts using seven different scenarios. The most accurate approach selects employing the ranking analysis over various statistical indices. The general regression neural network appears as the best intelligent model for the given purpose. This model presents the relative absolute deviation (RAD) of 0.6%, mean square error of 3.87 × 10−7, and regression coefficient of 0.99912 for predicting experimental measurements in the literature. The general regression neural network accuracy is far better than the perturbed-chain statistically associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT), Peng-Robinson, and Soave-Redlich-Kwong correlations. The most accurate thermodynamic approach, i.e., PC-SAFT, predicts H2 solubility in furfuryl alcohol and furfural with the RAD = 4.58% and 4.62%, while the general regression model has RAD = 0.79% and 0.5%. Indeed, the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy by more than three hundred percent. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Energy demand in the world is mostly met by conventional sources that cause carbon emissions. Considering environmental problems and the depletion of these sources in the near future, there is a trend towards renewable energy sources (RESs). Also, countries are implementing policies such as investment support, production support, quantity target, and limiting carbon emissions to increase the number of RESs. When these policies are compared, one of them can be superior to another in different countries. Also, superficial supports can cause an excessive financial burden on the governments. RESs have inherently intermittent power generation and in this respect, it is important to correctly estimate the RESs whose production changes with environmental conditions and to offer to the electricity markets optimally. For this reason, it is also important to know the structures of the electricity markets in bidding. Besides, RESs can come together to take an effective position in the market in terms of price and manage their imbalances. These structures can take names such as aggregator, virtual power plant (VPP), and portfolio. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this study aims to investigate in detail the methods applied to increase the number of RESs and the ways these resources participate in the electricity markets. In this context, subjects of policies promoting RESs, electricity market structures, development of the electricity market, optimum bidding strategy and ways of collective participation of RESs in the electricity markets are comprehensively examined under different sections. © 2021},

	abstract = {The concept of agricultural and environmental sustainability refers to minimizing the degradation of natural resources while increasing crop productions; assessment of inflow and outflow energy resources is helpful in highlighting the resilience of the system and maintaining its productivity. In this regard, the current study evaluated the amount of energy input–output of cotton productions and their environmental interventions. Data are randomly collected from 400 cotton farmers through face-to-face interview. Results suggested that the major energy is consumed by three culprits, i.e., chemical fertilizer, diesel fuel, and irrigation water (11,532.60, 11,121.54, and 4,531.97 MJ ha−1, respectively). Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is 1,106.12 kg CO2eq ha−1 with the main share coming from diesel fuel, machinery, and irrigation water. Stimulating data of energies, e.g., energy use efficiency (1.53), specific energy (7.69 MJ kg−1), energy productivity (0.13 kg MJ−1), and net energy gained (16,409.77 MJ ha−1). Further analysis using data envelopment analysis (DEA) showed that low technical efficiency, i.e., 69.02%, is the most probable cause of poor energy use efficiency. The impermanent trend in growth of energy efficiency has been witnessed with plausible potential of energy savings from 4,048.012 to 16,194.77 MJ ha−1 and a reduction of 148.96–595.96 kg CO2eq ha−1 in GHG emission. Cobb–Douglas production function is further applied to discover the associations of energy input to output, which inferred that chemical fertilizer, diesel fuel, machinery, and biocides have significant effect on cotton yield. The marginal physical productivity (MPP) values obliged that the additional use in energy (1 MJ) from fuel (diesel), biocides, and machinery can enhance cotton yield at the rate of 0.35, 1.52, and 0.45 kg ha−1, respectively. Energy saving best links with energy sharing data, i.e., 55.66% (direct), 44.34% (indirect), 21.05% (renewable), and 78.95% (nonrenewable), further unveiled the high usage of nonrenewable energy resources (fossil fuels) that ultimately contributes to high emissions of GHGs. We hope that these findings could help in the management of energy budget that we believe will reduce the high emissions of GHGs. Copyright © 2022 Abbas, Zhao, Waseem, Ahmed khan and Ahmad.},

	abstract = {Energy is the most significant factor in the development of a society and country. As a basic requirement, it is important to provide safe, inexpensive, uninterrupted, secure, and diversified energy supplies. At present, the major source of energy is produced from renewable and fossil resources. As the level of fossil resources is decreasing day by day, the application of renewable resources is increasing. This work describes the efficient utilization of renewable resources like water, solar, wind, and geothermal using various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The models like Back-Propagation, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN), Bayesian Regularization (BR), Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, and Gradient Descent with momentum and adaptation learning rate back-propagation algorithm (GDX) are used in the forecasting of water resources. For solar energy, models such as MLP, Fuzzy ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory), RB, and Shark Smell Optimization (SSO) algorithm and Feed-Forward Back-Propagation are employed. For wind energy, models like Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), Wavelet Neural Network (WNN), LM, Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) ANN, and MLP are used. For geothermal energy, models such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and MLP Feed-Forward algorithm are used to forecast it. All these models have been reviewed comprehensively with respect to their structures and methodologies during implementation. We are hopeful that this review article provides future directions in AI. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC. All rights reserved.},

These methods have been widely applied in the area of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) because of their computational capabilities. This paper conducts a systematic literature review on MCDM methods applied in different areas of SSCM. From the literature search, a total of 106 published journal articles have been selected and analyzed. Both individual and integrated MCDM methods applied in SSCM are reviewed and summarized. In addition, contributions, methodological focuses, and findings of the reviewed articles are discussed. It is observed that MCDM methods are widely used for analyzing barriers, challenges, drivers, enablers, criteria, performances, and practices of SSCM. In recent years, studies have focused on integrating more than one MCDM method to highlight methodological contributions in SSCM; however, in the literature, limited research papers integrate multiple MCDM methods in the area of SSCM. Most of the published articles integrate only two MCDM methods, and integration with other methods, such as optimization and simulation techniques, is missing in the literature.

	abstract = {The current trend indicates that energy demand and supply will eventually be controlled by autonomous software that optimizes decision-making and energy distribution operations. New state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technologies are integral in optimizing decision-making in energy distribution networks and systems. This study was conducted on data-driven probabilistic ML techniques and their real-time applications to smart energy systems and networks to highlight the urgency of this area of research. This study focused on two key areas: i) the use of ML in core energy technologies and ii) the use cases of ML for energy distribution utilities. The core energy technologies include the use of ML in advanced energy materials, energy systems and storage devices, energy efficiency, smart energy material manufacturing in the smart grid paradigm, strategic energy planning, integration of renewable energy, and big data analytics in the smart grid environment. The investigated ML area in energy distribution systems includes energy consumption and price forecasting, the merit order of energy price forecasting, and the consumer lifetime value. Cybersecurity topics for power delivery and utilization, grid edge systems and distributed energy resources, power transmission, and distribution systems are also briefly studied. The primary goal of this work was to identify common issues useful in future studies on ML for smooth energy distribution operations. This study was concluded with many energy perspectives on significant opportunities and challenges. It is noted that if the smart ML automation is used in its targeting energy systems, the utility sector and energy industry could potentially save from $237 billion up to $813 billion. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The year 2020 can be earmarked as the year of global supply chain disruption owing to the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). It is however not only because of the pandemic that supply chain risk assessment (SCRA) has become more critical today than it has ever been. With the number of supply chain risks having increased significantly over the last decade, particularly during the last 5 years, there has been a flurry of literature on supply chain risk management (SCRM), illustrating the need for further classification so as to guide researchers to the most promising avenues and opportunities. We therefore conduct a bibliometric and network analysis of SCRA publications to identify research areas and underlying themes, leading to the identification of three major research clusters for which we provide interpretation and guidance for future work. In doing so we focus in particular on the variety of parameters, analytical approaches, and characteristics of multi-criteria decision-making techniques for assessing supply chain risks. This offers an invaluable synthesis of the SCRA literature, providing recommendations for future research opportunities. As such, this paper is a formidable starting point for operations researchers delving into this domain, which is expected to increase significantly also due to the current pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. In addition to its theoretical contribution to scientific research on sustainable artificial intelligence in energy management, the research utilizes a novel topic modeling method in exploring scientific texts and identifying challenges and possible solutions. A variety of solutions was incorporated, including huggingface tool or elbow method, to address these challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Researchers have long been committed to identify nitrate sources in groundwater and to develop an advanced technique for its remediation because better apply remediation solution and management of water quality is highly dependent on the identification of the NO3− sources contamination in water. In this review, we systematically introduce nitrate source tracking tools used over the past ten years including dual isotope and multi isotope techniques, water chemistry profile, Bayesian mixing model, microbial tracers and land use/cover data. These techniques can be combined and exploited to track the source of NO3− as mineral or organic fertilizer, sewage, or atmospheric deposition. These available data have significant implications for making an appropriate measures and decisions by water managers. A continuous remediation strategy of groundwater was among the main management strategies that need to be applied in the contaminated area. Nitrate removal from groundwater can be accomplished using either separation or reduction based process. The application of these processes to nitrate removal is discussed in this review and some novel methods were presented for the first time. Moreover, the advantages and limitations of each approach are critically summarized and based on our own understanding of the subject some solutions to overcomes their drawbacks are recommended. Advanced techniques are capable to attain significantly higher nitrate and other co-contaminants removal from groundwater. However, the challenges of by-products generation and high energy consumption need to be addressed in implementing these technologies for groundwater remediation for potable use. © 2022},

Second, we use the methodology proposed for a systematic literature review on DS &BDA techniques in the SC &L fields aiming at classifying the existing DS &BDA models/techniques employed, structuring their practical application areas, identifying the research gaps and potential future research directions. We analyse 364 publications which use a variety of DS &BDA-driven modelling methods for SC &L processes across different decision-making levels.

Green supplier selection will help in increasing the environmental sustainability of a company. The green supplier selection is a group multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem in which multiple experts rate suppliers on different criteria. The criteria for green supplier selection can be classified into qualitative and quantitative categories. This paper presents a methodology for green supplier selection that uses thermodynamic features like energy, exergy and entropy of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it accounts for the quality of ratings assigned by experts. The method is not only effective in green supplier selection but also useful for resource allocation and scheduling of supplier training programs. The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing its results with those of other MCDM methods. Finally, the stability of the method is demonstrated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {As the global economy develops and the complexity of supply chains increases, the effective mitigation of sustainable supply chain risks in electronics manufacturing has become important. While quality function deployment (QFD) has been successfully applied to many fields of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM), there is a lack of research on constructing a house-of-quality model that can be combined with MCDM for connecting supply chain agility with sustainable supply chain risks, especially in the field of electronics manufacturing. The objective of this study was to develop an integrated framework of QFD and MCDM and to devise an effective method to mitigate sustainable supply chain risks by improving supply chain agility. Such a method can help the multinational electronics manufacturing industry to develop stable and sustainable supply chains. In a multinational electronic manufacturing enterprise as an example, the results showed that the case enterprise work should focus on improving agility ‘production and sales capability’, ‘quick decision-making/strategic flexibility’, ‘electronic shiapment of finished products to control shipment operations’, ‘supplier on-time delivery rates’ and ‘cost minimization’. Improving agility would help enhance the ‘credibility and competence of operators and leaders’ and ‘product safety and quality’ and reduce ‘goods disruption or delay due to inadequate supply mobility and poor financial performance’, ‘information system instability’, the ‘long product lead time’ and other key sustainable supply chain risks. The proposed framework can not only be effectively used by other electronics manufacturers to develop agile strategies to mitigate sustainable supply chain risks, but also provides a reference for risk management for manufacturers in other fields.. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {In light of current energy policies responding to rapid climate change, much attention has been directed to developing feasible approaches for transitioning energy production from fossil-based resources to renewable energy. Although existing studies analyze regional dispatch of renewable energy sources and capacity planning, they do not fully explore the impacts of the energy storage system technology's technical and economic characteristics on renewable energy integration and energy transition, and the importance of energy storage systems to the energy transition is currently ignored. To fill this gap, we propose an integrated optimal power flow and multi-criteria decision-making model to minimize system cost under operational constraints and evaluate the operational performance of renewable energy technologies with multidimensional criteria. The proposed method can identify the most critical features of energy storage system technologies to enhance renewable energy integration and achieve New York State's climate goals from 2025 to 2040. We discover that lead-acid battery requires an additional 38.66 GW capacity of renewable energy sources than lithium-ion battery to achieve the zero carbon dioxide emissions condition. Based on the cross-sensitivity analysis in the multidimensional evaluation, the vanadium redox flow battery performs the best, and the nickel-cadmium battery performs the worst when reaching the zero carbon dioxide emissions target in 2040. The results of the proposed model can also be conveniently generalized to select ESS technology based on the criteria preferences from RE integration and energy transition studies and serve as a reference for ESS configurations in future energy and power system planning. © 2023},

	abstract = {Reactive transport models (RTMs) are essential tools that simulate the coupling of advective, diffusive, and reactive processes in the subsurface, but their complexity makes them difficult to understand, develop and improve without accompanying statistical analyses. Although global sensitivity analysis (SA) can address these issues, the computational cost associated with most global SA techniques limits their use with RTMs. In this study, we apply distance-based generalized sensitivity analysis (DGSA), a novel and computationally efficient method of global SA, to a floodplain-scale RTM and compare DGSA results to those from local SA. Our test case focuses on the impact of 17 uncertain environmental parameters on spatially and temporally variable redox conditions within a floodplain aquifer. The input parameters considered include flow and diffusion rates, geochemical reaction rates, and the spatial distribution of sediment facies. Sensitivity was evaluated for three distinct components of the model response, encompassing both multidimensional and categorical output. Parameter rankings differ between local SA and DGSA, due to nonlinear effects of individual parameters and interaction effects between parameters. DGSA results show that fluid residence time, which is controlled by aquifer permeability, generally exerts a stronger control on redox conditions than do geochemical reaction rates. Sensitivity indices also demonstrate that sulfate reduction is key for establishing and maintaining reducing conditions throughout the aquifer. These results provide insights into the key drivers of heterogeneous redox processes within floodplain aquifers, as well as the main sources of uncertainty when modeling complex subsurface systems. © 2021.

	abstract = {Supplier Selection and Order Allocation (SSOA) are two critical strategic decisions in supply chain management. It is challenging to make these decisions when the demand is unknown. Prediction of demand is a complex problem as it highly depends on some parameters such as product cost. In this research, a three-stage framework is proposed to tackle the hurdles of SSOA planning problem. In the first stage, a hybrid deep learning technique based on multistep Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is developed to determine the future product demands. The efficiency of the developed model is evaluated using two standard error measuring techniques. Then, the results are compared with two other forecasting models to have accurate forecast. One of them is Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the other one is a deep learning model named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In the second stage, a fuzzy supplier evaluation model based on Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) model is developed to consider qualitative criteria. The third stage fetches the results from the forecasting model in Stage 1, and the results of the fuzzy model in the second stage. A unique multi-objective programming model is developed to select the best suppliers and to determine the allocated orders to them. To derive the efficient solutions, the weighted-sum method is used. The application of the proposed framework is discussed using a real dataset from the Canadian Juice industries. The results of the performance comparison among the considered forecasting models show that the developed LSTM model can lead to less forecasting errors compared to the SARIMA and MLP models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present study investigated the performance of natural Moroccan zeolites and clay in the removal of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solutions. The deposits of the samples are extracted from the Teteoune (sample 1), Kenitra (sample 2), Khroubga (sample 3), and Benghrir (sample 4) regions of Morocco. The samples were characterized by the X-ray diffraction technique. Sorption experiments were carried out by batch experimental to examine the effects of contact time, solution pH, initial concentration of MB, and biosorbent dosage of samples. In the next step, an integrated methodology is adapted by applying the computational intelligence packages to this problem to develop empirical models and to conduct an optimization to maximize the removal percentage. The empirical or digital twin models are generated using machine learning techniques including regression tree (RT), support vector machine, ensemble, and gaussian process regression (GPR), a statistical technique including multivariate regression (MVR), and neural network techniques including artificial neural network ( ANN) and group method of data handling (GMDH). The results have shown that the ANN technique having 10 hidden layers trained using the Bayesian regularization algorithm can accurately predict the removal percentage with an RMSE = 0.88, R2 = 0.9961, MSE = 0.67, and MAE = 0.43. The second-best technique is GPR followed by GMDH. The worst techniques are MVR and RT. The single-objective optimization was applied using simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA) to maximize the removal percentage for each material to find the optimal mass, initial concentration, contact time, and pH. The results have revealed that the SA technique is not fully capable to find the true optima, whereas PSO and GA have shown conformity on the optimal removal percentage. The optimized indicator came out to be 85.32%, 90.23%, 93.25%, and 97.21% for material 1, 2, 3, and 4 which was 49%, 14.69%, 20.16%, and 45.11% for material 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that the sample from the region of Benghrir has the best removal performance of methylene blue from aqueous solutions marking up to a high digit of 97.21%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Considering resilience methods are usually designed as reactions to single discrete disruptions rather than situational reactions to real-time changes, this study proposes a novel redundancy optimisation approach dynamically providing each demand market with a pair of supply routes to optimise the flexible redundancy of ISN, thereby ensuring the survivability of supply chains and demand markets under continuous changes. Based on this, we propose the ISN design (ISND) model to capture the trade-off between total cost and viability performance under facility and transportation disruption. The Lagrangian relaxation algorithm, combined with the sub-gradient method and the improved cellular genetic algorithm, are utilised for solving problems of different scales. To test the performance of the model and corresponding algorithms, we also conduct a numerical analysis of the data from medical equipment ISN in southern China. The results indicate that the ISND model can effectively optimise ISN structures, which makes it possible to dynamically provide flexible redundancy; the two algorithms also show good calculation efficiency. The relationship between ISN structure and viability performance is thus observed and explained. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Climatic parameters influence CO2 emissions and the complexity of the relationship is not fully captured in biophysical models. Machine learning (ML) is now being applied to environmental problems, and it is, therefore, opportune to investigate ML models in CO2 predictions from agricultural soils. In this study, six ML models were compared for their predictive performance by comparing field measurements of CO2 emissions from two fertiliser treatments: inorganic fertiliser (IF) and solid cattle manure supplemented with inorganic fertiliser (SCM) applied to a maize-soy rotation. The study also included a generalised scenario where all the data from IF and SCM were included in one dataset. The ML models include support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), feed-forward neural network (FNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM). The input parameters were soil moisture, soil temperature, soil organic matter, soil total carbon, soil total nitrogen, air temperature, solar radiation and pan evaporation, while the output parameter was field measured CO2 emissions. The results of this study demonstrated that RF was the best at predicting CO2 emissions from IF [coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.92 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.27], SCM (R2 = 0.94 and RMSE = 2.86) and generalised scenarios (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 3.05). We conclude that ML models provide an innovative, robust and time-efficient alternative to biophysical models. © 2021 IAgrE},

A comprehensive evaluation index system is constructed based on four levels: environmental, economic, managerial, and social. G1-entropy is used to revise the empirical results of experts and improve the accuracy and practicality of evaluation index weight. The study’s feasibility and practicality are demonstrated through the evaluation of a sewage treatment project by Q City Water Group Co., Ltd. in China. The research on multi-attribute decision-making is crucial, especially as stakeholders are increasingly involved in decision-making issues. Environmental problems, particularly water pollution, have become increasingly severe, necessitating the scientific evaluation of sewage treatment projects to improve living standards and promote social sustainability. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation system and applies the G1-entropy improved TOPSIS model to determine an objective and accurate evaluation index weight. The improved TOPSIS method simplifies the calculation process, making it more efficient and practical. This study’s technological implications are significant, as it presents a novel and efficient approach for evaluating sewage treatment projects. The proposed system and model can provide technical support and decision-making guidance for the operation and management of sewage treatment projects, thus enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, the study’s practical implications are important for promoting the sustainable development of environmental projects and enterprises.

	abstract = {Food industry as one of the most important and influential industries plays an important role in the health and well-being of the community. It is also important for the country’s economy, export, and inter-state relations. As the industry expands and competition becomes tougher, the development of new products that can compete in this competitive market has become a major concern for manufacturers but the production of new products is always associated with uncertainties and risks, the management of which is the core of the new product development process and plays an important role in the success of industries. Risks occur in different shapes at every stage of the new product development process from design to consumption. In this study, the new product development process in a dairy company is investigated. A quantitative approach is proposed to identify and rank the risks affecting this process using the combined Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Shannon entropy method is also used to weight the criteria in the TOPSIS method. Identified risks by considering expert’s opinion were scored from 0 to 10 regarding FMEA method factors (Severity, Occurrence, Detective), then by utilizing Shannon entropy method in TOPSIS each risk was weighted and ranked. 14 risks are first identified and then ranked based on 30 experts opinions from different parts of the company such as marketing, accounting, engineering, staff, management etc. and prior studies. The results show that ’Mismatching product Specifications with costumer needs and tastes’ and ’The emergence of a new rival’ are the most important risk factors for new product development. Risk reduction strategies based on the standard of project management, firm strengths and weaknesses and expert opinions on all risk factors are provided. At the end, some recommendations are provided to the managers of the company. The proposed approach is applied in Ramak Company and the results are approved by experts, more importantly, they are agree that the proposed approach can be used to identify, evaluate and present risk reduction strategies in the food industry. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

These are associated with additional losses related to energy, water, labour, and other resources employed by the food industry. The water-energy-food nexus explains the need for their joint optimisation. The valorisation of FWL is the second most crucial strategy after avoiding its formation. It can be directed to various chemicals, fuels, and materials through different biorefinery processes. Integrated biorefineries are seen as the most efficient tools for this transformation. Their design and implementation are carried out respecting its sustainability and, thus, contributing to the global circular economy.

	abstract = {The optimal planning of grid-connected microgrids (MGs) has been extensively studied in recent years. While most of the previous studies have used fixed or time-of-use (TOU) prices for the optimal sizing of MGs, this work introduces real-time pricing (RTP) for implementing a demand response (DR) program according to the national grid prices of Iran. In addition to the long-term planning of MG, the day-ahead operation of MG is also analyzed to get a better understanding of the DR program for daily electricity dispatch. For this purpose, four different days corresponding to the four seasons are selected for further analysis. In addition, various impacts of the proposed DR program on the MG planning results, including sizing and best configuration, net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE), and emission generation by the utility grid, are investigated. The optimization results show that the implementation of the DR program has a positive impact on the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of MG. The NPC and COE are reduced by about USD 3700 and USD 0.0025/kWh, respectively. The component size is also reduced, resulting in a reduction in the initial cost. Carbon emissions are also reduced by 185 kg/year. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays the steel market is becoming ever more competitive for European steelworks, especially as far as flat steel products are concerned. As such competition determines the price products, profit can be increased only by lowering production and commercial costs. Production yield can be significantly increased through an appropriate scheduling of the semi-manufactured products among the available sub-processes, to ensure that customers' orders are timely completed, resources are optimally exploited, and delays are minimized. Therefore, an ever-increasing attention is paid toward production optimization through efficient scheduling strategies in the scientific and industrial communities. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to improve the flexibility of production scheduling in steelworks producing flat steel products. Such approach combines three methods holding different scopes and modelling different aspects: an auction-based multi-agent system is applied to face production uncertainties, multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming is used for global optimal scheduling of resources under steady conditions, while a continuous flow model copes with long-term production scheduling. According to the obtained simulation results, the integration and combination of these three approaches allow scheduling production in a flexible way by providing the capability to adapt to different production conditions.  © 2022 - The authors.

To the best of our knowledge, the current study is pioneering as it introduces a new fuzzy chance-constrained two-stage method that can be used to undertake the deterministic non-fuzzy programming of the proposed model.

	abstract = {This exploration is aimed at reducing the waste of resources in the supply chain inventory management and provide better services for green supply chain management. It mainly proposes a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) (IPSO-BPNN) and applies it to inventory management prediction. First, the important technologies of green supply chain and intelligent supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the ecological environment. Next, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is optimized based on the adaptive improvement of the learning factor and the addition of the speed mutation operator. Then, it is applied to the learning and training of BPNN. Finally, the simulation experiment of the combination model is conducted. The application fields of the combination model are analyzed. The results show that a single BPNN model will produce large errors in the training process. The final error of BPNN using the traditional PSO algorithm is 0.0259, while the error of BPNN optimized by IPSO is 0.0163. The optimized combination model has higher accuracy, better performance, and the lowest error rate. The classification error rate of its training set and test set is 1.51 and 2.16, respectively. The mean square error of the training set is 0.0163 and that of the test set is 0.0229. Under 6 12 different hidden nodes, the daily measurement model error and monthly measurement model error are both low when the number of nodes is 11. Moreover, the training set is always better than the test set. Finally, the network structure of the combination model is determined as the structure of 6-11-1. This prediction module will provide purchase volume suggestions and inventory volume suggestions to provide a feasible direction for the green development of inventory management.  © 2022 Ying Guan et al.},

Our systematic search of the related literature identifies 150 journal articles published between 1998 and 2020. A thorough bibliometric analysis is completed to develop the past and present state of this literature. A co-citation analysis on this pool of articles provides an understanding of the clusters of knowledge that constitute this research area. To further direct our discussions, we develop and validate an AI taxonomy which we use as a scale to conduct our bibliometric and co-citation analyses. The proposed taxonomy consists of three research categories of (a) sensing and interacting, (b) learning, and (c) decision making. These categories collectively establish the basis for present and future research on the application of AI methods in SCM literature and practice. Our analysis of the primary research clusters finds that learning methods are slowly getting momentum and sensing and interacting methods offer an emerging area of research. Finally, we provide a roadmap into future studies on AI applications in SCM. Our analysis underpins the importance of behavioral considerations in future studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, we discuss the theoretical foundations and empirical manifestations of the related concepts and propose a framework for analysis of agricultural supply chain viability. The methods and indicators are discussed in a critical manner. We show that the considerations on the level of aggregation, parts of the supply chain covered and data sources are important when designing analytical tools for agricultural supply chain viability.

	abstract = {Nitrate is one of the most complicated forms of nitrogen found in aquatic surface systems, which results in the eutrophication of the water. During the last few decades, due to agriculture and animal husbandry activities, as well as urban development, a significant amount of pollutants have accumulated in the Jajrood river in northern Iran. In this research, we simulated nitrate load in a rural watershed to assess the outlet stream’s qualitative status and evaluate the influence of best management practices (BMPs). To accomplish this, we prepared, processed, and integrated different datasets, including land-use land-cover (LULC) maps, physiographic layers, and hydrological and agricultural datasets. In the modeling section, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate nitrate load over 28 years (1991–2019). Additionally, the multi-objective optimization algorithm (MOPSO) was implemented to reduce the intended objective functions, including the number of best management practices and the nitrate concentration considering different scenarios. The calibration of the basin’s discharge and nitrate indicated that the SWAT model performed well in simulating the catchment’s streamflow (R2 = 0.71) and nitrate (R2 = 0.69). The recommended BMPs for reducing nutrient discharge from the basin are using vegetated filter strips on river banks and fertilizer reduction in agricultural activities. According to the results from this investigation, the integrated model demonstrates a strong ability to optimally determine the type, size, and location of BMPs in the watershed as long as the reduction criteria change. In a situation of water scarcity, the studies reported here could provide useful information for policymakers and planners to define water conservation policies and strategies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Water resources in watersheds are severely affected by climate change, water scarcity, and frequent droughts. This leads to a conflict between different users of water, especially between agriculture and the environment sectors. Due to the multidimensional and multiscale nature of watershed management and climate change, it is necessary to provide some tools and solutions for sustainable management and planning of watersheds under climate change. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to develop a conceptual framework in the field of tools and solutions for integrated watershed management and planning to optimally allocate water resources between different sections in the watersheds. In order to achieve this goal, the literature on the watershed management was reviewed, and it was found that there are three categories of studies in this field. The first category includes studies that have managed the watershed using hydrological and economic simulation tools. The second category is studies that consider environmental aspects as well and combine hydrological, economic, and environmental simulation tools. The third category is studies that consider users’ behavior very important in watershed management and employ some behavior-specific tools to simulate the behavioral complexities of users. The results showed that the combination of all hydrological, socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral components and the use of component-specific tools to simulate these components can achieve sustainable watershed management. Furthermore, the present integrated framework can be used in various case studies around the world due to its comprehensiveness and operationality for integrated watershed management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Three parameters, i.e., nitrogen content (0.25 to 1%), fungal inoculum (0.25 to 1%), and duration (3 to 12 days), were optimized for maximum CMCase production using Response surface methodology-Box Behnken design (RSM-BBD). The quadratic response surface was suitable, and the model was significant. However, higher-order machine learning (ML) models were applied as the RSM-BBD model had a low R2 value (0.85) and negative predicted R2 value (−0.82). The supervised ML regression models, i.e., Artificial neural network (ANN) with Bayesian Regularization Neural Network (BRNN) and Radial Basis function Neural Network (RBFNN), Support vector machine (SVM) with Polynomial kernel (SPK), and Gaussian kernel (SGK), and Gaussian process learner (GPL) with the exponential kernel (GEK) and squared exponential kernel (GSEK) were applied. The RBFNN was the best performing model with a mean squared error (MSE) value of 0.0025 and an R2 value of 0.98. The maximum CMCase production of 13.89 U/gds was at yeast extract 0.25%, fungal inoculum 0.625%, and duration of 12 days. There was almost a threefold increase in CMCase production after optimization compared to the screening experiments (4.7 U/gds). © 2022},

However, there has been little attention to evaluating economic and regulatory (E&R) uncertainties, despite their enormous impact on the project cashflows. Consequently, this review analyzes, classifies, and discusses 130 articles dealing with the design of renewable energy projects under E&R uncertainties. After performing a survey and identifying the selected manuscripts, and the few previous reviews on the matter, the following innovative categorization is designed: sources of uncertainty, uncertainty characterization methods, problem formulations, solution methods, and regulatory frameworks. The classification reveals that electricity price is the most considered source of uncertainty, often alone, despite the existence of six other equally influential groups of E&R uncertainties. In addition, real options and optimization arise as the two main approaches researchers use to solve problems in energy system design. Subsequently, the following aspects of interest are discussed in depth: how modeling can be improved, which are the most influential variables, and potential lines of research. Conclusions show the necessity of modeling E&R uncertainties with currently underrepresented methods, suggest several policy recommendations, and encourage the integration of prevailing approaches. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bleed–feed is a novel technology that allows biomanufacturers to skip bioreactor setups. However, the time at which bleed–feed is performed is important for its successful implementation. In addition, bleed–feed operations involve unique trade-offs that affect the system's throughput. For example, the biomass replenishment amount during bleed–feed affects the expected yield of the system. In this study, we formalise these operational trade-offs and formulate a stochastic optimisation model using renewal reward theory. Our analytical model captures both the biological dynamics and operational trade-offs of bleed–feed decisions to maximise throughput. We present an industry case study to demonstrate the use of our model. Through several practically relevant scenarios, we assess the potential impact of implementing bleed–feed on current practice and develop insights for practitioners. Although our work is primarily motivated by the biomanufacturing industry, our analytical model and insights are applicable to other industries that involve fermentation. Our results show that bleed–feed brings the most benefit for fast-growing cells or high-risk cultures. Although counter-intuitive, our numerical analysis shows that it is optimal not to adopt bleed–feed when biomass accumulation is too slow. © 2021 The Author(s).

The phenomena associated with a decrease in the intensity of wear and arising in the engagement of a worm gear with limitations on rigidity are investigated. A mathematical model of a two-parameter problem of optimizing the wear rate using Lagrange multipliers is formed. The concept of increasing the resource of a mechanical transmission due to the availability of gapless contact between the worm and the wheel is analyzed. The authors conclude that using sliding supports will reduce the time for adjusting machine tools and make the process of manufacturing housing parts more economical. An analytical apparatus for determining the main parameter of the worm gear by the minimum wear criterion is created. The assumption about the rational area of using this design of the backlash-free transmission for the rotary table at low gear ratios and the use of quadric-thread worms is substantiated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Challenges of high energy efficiency, water saving, low-carbon emissions, waste management and food saving have been considerable pressures on both regional and global sustainable development. This paper reviews the water-energy extended nexuses (e.g. food, greenhouse gases, waste, pollution, land and others) from the perspective of relationship and practicability in relieving the challenges towards environmentally-related sustainable development goals. A specific issue identified is that with the popularity of “nexus” and extension beyond resources nexus, the positioning and identity of nexuses become ambiguous. In most cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace specific expressions such as multi-criteria optimisation, trade-offs, correlation/relationship, input-output assessment, material flow analysis, and integrated design. The methodologies (e.g. input-output analysis and life cycle assessment) entail needing to be adequately integrated or expanded for diverse water-energy extended nexuses. It is crucial for evaluating resource flows in multiple regions and sectors and assessing the associated environment-economic impacts. A standardised understanding like establishing life cycle assessment and even more quantified footprints could ensure that the nexus would not fall as the group of a buzzword and contribute to sustainable development goals. This study serves as a stepping stone to establish quantified characteristics or components as eligibility to classify as nexus approaches and studies. © 2021},

Due to the great capability of data-driven methods in analyzing complex systems, several attempts have been made to study various desalination systems using data-driven approaches. In this state-of-the-art review, the application of various artificial intelligence and design of experiment data-driven methods for analyzing different desalination technologies have been thoroughly investigated. According to the applications of data-driven methods in the field of desalination, the reviewed investigations are classified into five categories namely performance prediction using operational parameters, performance prediction using design parameters, optimization and correlation development, maintenance, and control of desalination systems. For each category, valuable information about the data-driven methods such as inputs, outputs, hyper-parameter tuning methods, and size of datasets have been provided and the main remarks are reported. The findings showed that data-driven methods can play a vital role in each aforementioned application for both thermal and membrane-based desalination technologies. Eventually, the research gaps are highlighted and a roadmap is also provided for future data-driven analysis of various desalination systems and their further advancement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This invited review paper presents state-of-the-art applications to energy–water system optimisation with multiple technologies, implying possible (non)monetary benefits/impacts for facility custodians in urban precincts. To solve outstanding problems, optimisation modelling frameworks were examined in the quest for undertaking an integrated precinct-scale energy–water system planning. Underlying optimisation methods were identified for addressing nested long/short-term capital/managerial decisions that ensure cost-effectiveness and system reliability, especially selecting diversified investment portfolios to allocate controllable assets across energy and water resources. Despite the ongoing energy–water nexus investigations, the integrated energy–water system planning seems to lack a general optimisation problem formulation that reveal synergies between energy and water. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear nature of energy–water interactions, mathematical properties must be carefully treated for tackling complex integrated energy–water system planning optimisation problems. To optimise integrated precinct-scale energy–water system plans, classical and heuristic techniques can be jointly implemented for solving (re)formulated problems with hard constraints and desirable cost/resource-saving objectives. Critical energy–water system sizing/scheduling tasks were discussed while covering deterministic and probabilistic procedures to support decision-making under uncertainty. Although different combined stochastic programs have been proposed incorporating actual outcomes and empirical measurements as well as prior information and expert knowledge, inherent energy–water demand/supply uncertainties should be realistically characterised by parameterising representable random perturbation sets. To find robust optimal feasible solutions to sensitive parameters during extreme load/cost volatility situations, historical energy–water usage data can be randomly perturbed for uncertainty realisation in prospective scenarios, capturing spatiotemporal correlations that avoid overconservative worst-case expected values. From the scientific paradigm of physics-informed data-driven optimisation modelling, robust approaches can be adopted for severe societal/natural events to advance state-of-the-art applications in integrated precinct-scale energy–water system planning and engineering design. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Conventional farming necessitates a large number of resources and infrastructure such as land, irrigation, manpower to manage farms, etc. Modern initiatives are required to automate conventional farms. Smart indoor farms offer the potential to remedy the shortfalls of conventional farms by providing a controlled, intelligent, and smart environment. This paper presents a three-dimensional perspective consisting of soilless farming, energy harvesting, and smart technologies, which could be considered as the three important characteristics of smart indoor farms. A six-layer smart indoor farms architecture has also been proposed, which explains how data are collected using various sensors and devices and then transmitted onto the cloud infrastructure for further analysis and control through various layers. Artificial lighting, smart nutrition management, and artificial climate control, to name a few, are some of the important requirements for smart indoor farms while considering control and service management factors. The major bottleneck in installing such systems is both the economical and the technical constraints. However, with the evolution of technology (and when they become widely available in the near future), a more favourable farming scenario may emerge. Furthermore, smart indoor farms could be viewed as a potential answer for meeting the demands of a sustainable agricultural revolution as we move closer to Agriculture 4.0. Finally, in order to adapt smart indoor farms and their study scope, our work has presented various research areas to potential researchers. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this claim is not strong enough to generalize the whole industry as unsustainable. Indeed, the palm oil industry seems to be pursuing Industry-4.0-technologies and circular-economy-practices to improve its unsustainable practices. This study endeavours to overcome the shortcomings in the palm oil industry that is fragmented and unclear. This study develops a structural literature review published in 2011–2021. This study presents a conceptualization framework through four cluster groups (1) industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application; (2) sustainability practices; (3) sustainability performance; and (4) moderating factors. Subsequently, the present study develops nine propositions from these concepts due to descriptive and content analyses. Then, the study theorizes that industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application has a quasi-effect on sustainability performance, and sustainability practices may act as a mediator in this relationship and a moderating factor that may influence the above relationship. This study contributes to both theory and practice by advancing the current understanding of industry-4.0-in-a-circular-economy application in the POI, especially its impact on sustainability practices and performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Optimizing the multi-criteria decision-making process is an integrated set of information-processing-decision activities in which actual data, expert knowledge using fuzzy inference rules, Geographic Information System, and Bayesian networks are combined. Using proposed tools leads to designing a new approach to improving the energy efficiency of cities and reducing CO2 emissions using renewable energy. The integration of modern computational methods leads to rational planning of environmentally friendly and energy-conscious smart cities by the provisions of the Fit for 55 packages. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been demonstrated in the example of three scenarios considering different types of renewable energy sources that can be implemented in urban areas. The success probability of decarbonizing these areas was calculated for defined quarters of the city of Zielona Góra with different parameters. Thereby the usefulness of the method was confirmed. Significantly, the likelihood of a successful deployment of photovoltaics (PV) in urban areas was estimated at 55.25% and for heat pumps at 28.79%. The proposed method enables a clear interpretation of the results, which may be the basis for urban energy efficiency planning. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Environmental impacts (EIs) of building stocks have been receiving significant attention in recent decades as they consume more than 40% of the world's energy, release one third of total greenhouse gas emissions, and account for 30% of global landfill waste. Prior efforts have focused on mitigating EIs during the operation stage of buildings, while the environmental performance of other stages is relatively overlooked. Addressing this, whole-building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has gained prominence from a life-cycle perspective to ensure the best environmental performance. However, there is an array of factors that can affect WBLCA results, and such uncertainties render decisions made for sustainable development untenable. Aiming to understand the comprehensive uncertain sources of WBLCA (what) and their corresponding solutions (how), this paper systematically reviews existing publications on WBLCA, presents its status and challenges, and analyses the taxonomy of uncertainties and eight uncertainty methods and variants thereof. Accordingly, a framework is developed that enables LCA practitioners to readily understand the correlation between WBLCA uncertainties and solutions, and conveniently locate and appraise them throughout the WBLCA process. Upon answering the known-what and known-how questions, this study contributes to the body of knowledge of LCA by providing a comprehensive and systematic methodology to evaluate the EIs of buildings. © 2022},

	abstract = {As an outcome of economies of scale, demand growth can benefit companies in various ways. However, demand fulfillment and management are just not possible in a supply chain whose managers focus only on cost minimization. For this reason, the present paper proposes a sustainable, efficient, customer-centered and resilient closed-loop supply chain network. Limited access to labor during the Covid-19 pandemic, traffic congestion due to transportation of products, as well as transparency through the Blockchain technology are some of the key considerations in our supply chain network design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt where such a supply chain network is designed, solved and analyzed based on iterative and integrated models. The fuzzy goal programming is adopted as a solution approach for both of the proposed models. The applications of the proposed models are demonstrated in the context of a case study. Furthermore, the results showed that the iterative model can focus on the expenditure minimization strategy and the integrated model can focus on the transparency and efficiency strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Global climate change has several implications on food security. The task of feeding the growing human population with limited resources is a challenging mission. With modern climate-resilient cultivars and optimized management practices, agronomists are trying to provide solutions to optimize the demand and supply balance in the food system. Crop simulation models play a vital role in assessing cultivar’s performances with extrapolated conditions (soil and weather types) and resources (management practices), at varying spatiotemporal scales as large and multilocation field experiments with scarce resources are challenging. New cultivars need to be updated with their genetic coefficients to simulate crop growth and development and hence prediction of phenology and yield under different environments. Most of the modeling studies rely on the calibrated genetic coefficients of crops from different geographical regions and do not calibrate it properly which brings biasness in the model output. Different optimization methods for parameter estimation play a crucial role in meeting these requirements in short period. The selection of methods to estimate genetic coefficients also requires careful cataloguing of input data using standardized and appropriate protocols. With robust estimates of genetic coefficients, the reliability on simulation model will be boosted after proper statistical evaluation on the need of parameterization, testing model symmetry, and improving modeling metrics. Moreover, properly calibrated and validated model can be used to assess crop potential yield analysis, yield gap assessment, projection of climate and economic, and other decision support analysis which helps growers to enhance profitability and strengthen environmental stewardship. In this chapter, we discuss and describe different method of estimating crop genetic coefficients for simulation models. We also highlight advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods with special emphasis on the need of ensembling methods to minimize bias and inherent uncertainties in the estimation of these coefficients. This chapter will provide crop model developers and users an insight over different optimization methods and ensembling needs. © The Editor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {The energy and water sectors are intrinsically linked to meet several consumer needs. A holistic analysis is required to quantify the technoeconomic and environmental benefits and impacts of energy–water interactions. Despite ongoing investigations into assessing the integrated energy and water resource use such as those covered in this review paper, the energy–water nexus linkages seem to remain analytically undefined in a systemic relationship to assess trade-offs among different objectives of energy and water usage, thereby revealing synergies between energy and water. Given an observed lack of quantitative assessments of integrated energy and water resource use in local sites such as urban precincts, the present study comprehensively reviewed literature covering energy and water systems, technologies, management measures, schemes and approaches for integrated planning at various scales. Planning challenges were identified for energy and water system integration at precinct scale. To advance state-of-the-art applications, this paper proposes research directions for integrated precinct-scale energy–water system planning. In addition, planning opportunities for integrated energy and water systems were identified towards precinct-scale deployments. Several findings indicated critical roles of complex inter-building effects from precinct elements with energy–water system interdependencies. In urban precincts, integrated energy and water system plans could enhance resource sustainability at a lower cost. The strategic approach outlined in this paper will help facility custodians to optimise complex energy–water portfolio capital investments for precinct-scale developments, including available retrofit projects supported by appropriate financing options. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Operational factors may influence chemical and physical risk occurrences associated with high-hazard plant operation in the chemical process sectors. Thus, safety-risk technologies and assessments should be explored considering potential events that result in fatalities, property destruction, economic loss, and environmental degradation. This research established a systematic framework for reducing safety risks to decrease accidents and hazards associated with the inherent production processes, as well as proposing process-level maintenance techniques for the specified hydrocarbon processing industry. First, the hazards of chemical reactivity were studied to determine which equipment performance poses the greatest risk. Physical and chemical risks were obtained to configure out identical nodes of expressing severe hazard via a qualitative assessment using the HAZOP study. The fuzzy best-to-worst technique combined with an analytical network process (fuzzy-BWANP) was utilized to assess the safety-risk criticality due to the operational reaction process, environmental risk, economical safety, and occupational management. Furthermore, the annual loss of expectancy and exposure factors for the earlier categories based on their operational expenses and failure time were estimated. The case study examined how to increase the process feasibility of an acrylonitrile plant. Consideration of economic loss resulted in the extraction of a risk index that helps decision-makers in determining priority tasks for addressing urgent hazards in any hydrocarbon processing industry's safety management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The present EIs have been challenged with different kinds of technical and economic aspects over the system lifecycle, including recourses misuse, pointless competition between end-user parties, and increasing decommissioned waste materials. Recently, decision-makers, policymakers, scholars, engineers, and practitioners have been interested in integrating CE and IEs. Remarkably, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding a solid connection between CE, IEs, and other contributing parameters. The main idea behind the CE is to make better products, materials, and system components utilization throughout their sequential lifecycles. In this chapter, the aim is to investigate sustainable CE in the design and development of EIs. Thus, the Risk Management (RM) of a supercritical water gasification system as a critical EI has been studied to identify the relevant implication in practice, gaps in the existing knowledge, and cutting-edge strategies to empower the CE in the lifecycle of EIs, such as recertification, refurbishment and remanufacturing, recycling, to decommission, landfill, and more.

From a regulatory standpoint, the goal of this paper is to maximize the profitability of an entire supply chain. As a result, a constrained finite time Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) approach is provided for determining an entity’s optimal profit state in a supply chain. The framework is represented by discrete-time linear dynamical equations for each entity in the supply chain network, taking state and input variables into account. The problem is formulated in terms of a convex quadratic programming optimization for which several numerically efficient algorithms are readily available. In order to validate the approach, it was tested on two topologies. The first topology is a fully connected supply chain with six nodes; the second is a simple topology based on the Iranian pharmaceutical supply chain. The results indicate that the proposed approach successfully planned production and financing decisions within the simulated supply chain and obtained globally optimal profit for all supply chain stakeholders. © 2022 by the authors.

One critical step to warranting patient safety and health is to improve the performance of clinical departments. To this end, this paper integrated resilience engineering (RE) and lean management (LM) principles to propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing the performance of clinical departments. Initially, the Best-Worst Method was utilized to determine the relative importance of each indicator. Afterward, a validated questionnaire was administered to clinical department specialists to collect the required data. The data envelopment analysis model was then employed to evaluate the clinical department in a real-world case study. In addition, the impact of each indicator on the clinical department was analyzed using robustness analysis and statistical tests. The outcomes indicated the ranking of clinics from best to worst performance. Furthermore, the best and worst indicators for each clinic and the entire clinical department were determined. Moreover, a strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis was used to propose appropriate strategies to improve the performance of a clinical department. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the performance of clinical departments in terms of RE and LM indicators.

Focusing on environmental, social, and economic considerations, sustainability can play an effective role along with Lean production in improving the performance of organizations. The present study introduces an innovative lean-production-sustainability framework for performance evaluation of a pharmaceutical factory. Then, the significance of each sub-indicator is calculated based on the best-worst method (BWM). The required data were collected using a standard questionnaire, and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) was employed to assess the performance of the production line of the case-study company in Tehran. Using sensitivity analysis to understand the positive and/or negative impact of each sub-indicator on the production line performance leads to the generation of appropriate improvement measures. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the sub-indicators of Investment and reduction of operation and maintenance costs, training, development, working conditions, customer orientation, and standard product are the weaknesses of the studied company, and the sub-indicators of waste reduction and pull system are its strengths. Then, with the assistance of the expert committee and based on existing threats and opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, the results of the conducted Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat (SWOT) analysis provided appropriate strategies for improving the performance of the production unit. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to quantitatively and qualitatively use these indicators in order to evaluate a pharmaceutical company.

These factors complicate their structure as the focal company is responsible for the problems experienced at each stage in the multi-tier supply chain. The critical issue for focal companies in managing their multi-tier supply chain is to adopt sustainability standards. One of the study's contributions is the role of weight determination in the tiers and evaluation of alternative suppliers in facilitating the effective management of multi-tier supply chains, especially in complex industries such as the food industry. The other contribution of this study is its proposition for a multi-stage framework based on sustainability concerns. The study identifies 14 criteria for companies in diffusing sustainability standards throughout multi-tier supply chains. The weights of these criteria are determined for each tier of the food supply chain using the Best Worst Method. Results show that the ‘environmental’ criteria are most important for supply chain tiers in the food industry. Supply chain visibility/traceability is the most important criteria for the first tier, followed by environmental responsibilities, for the second and environmental competencies for the third. Finally, for the food company, PROMETHEE is used to evaluate three alternative suppliers for each tier. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In the context of q-ROFSs, entropy is a significant measure for depicting fuzziness and uncertain information of q-ROFS and the discrimination measure is generally used to quantify the distance between two q-ROFSs by evaluating the amount of their discrimination. Thus, the aim of this study is to propose a novel integrated framework based on multi-attribute multi-objective optimization with the ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA) method with q-rung orthopair fuzzy information (q-ROFI). In this approach, an integrated weighting process is presented by combining objective and subjective weights of criteria with q-ROFI. Inspired by the q-rung orthopair fuzzy entropy and discrimination measure, objective weights of criteria are estimated by entropy and discrimination measure-based model. Whereas, the subjective weights are derived based on aggregation operator and the score function under q-ROFS environment. In this respect, novel entropy and discrimination measure are proposed for q-ROFSs. Furthermore, to display the feasibility and usefulness of the introduced approach, a case study related to SWD method selection is presented under q-ROFS perspective. Finally, comparison and sensitivity investigation are presented to confirm the robustness and solidity of the introduced approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Discovering such performance-advantaged molecules and the paths and processes to make them rapidly and systematically can transform manufacturing practices. We discuss retrosynthetic approaches, text mining, natural language processing, and modern machine learning methods to enable digitalization. Laboratory and multiscale computation automation via active learning are crucial to complement existing literature and expedite discovery and valuable data collection without a human in the loop.

	abstract = {There is an urgent need for scientific management of agricultural water and land resources to cope with global warming and water shortages. Therefore, a stochastic multi-objective non-linear programming model was established under the society-economy-ecology framework in this study, which is capable of (1) considering the carbon sink function of farmland vegetation and the carbon emissions produced from the input of production materials; (2) dealing with the potential impact of agricultural water use on ecology by the indexes of water scarcity and degradation footprint (3) weighing the conflicts and contradictions among different developing targets with economic benefits, and water productivity as well as ecological considerations; (4) obtaining the planting structure, irrigation water allocation schemes and irrigation schedules. In order to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the model, it was applied to Huangyang Irrigation District in Shiyang River Basin, northwest China. After optimization, the net carbon sink increased by 2.55 × 104 t of which fertilizer contributed nearly 50% of carbon emission, while the water footprint reduced by 0.48 × 108 m3. To analyze the impact of the different allocation schemes of water and land resources on the ecological, economic and social subsystems as well as their interaction, coupling coordination degree (CCD) models were introduced to evaluate status quo and the optimization results of different models. The results showed that, compared with the single-objective models and the status quo, the proposed model has improved the value of CCD from 0.428 to 0.674. The proposed model can promote the harmonious and sustainable development of agricultural production and is equally applicable to agricultural management systems in the regions with similar conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The heavy reliance of the transportation and power generation sector on fossil fuels is seriously impacting the environment. Transitioning towards more sustainable transportation modes is necessary to reduce this dependency on fossil fuels. Even though shifting toward electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce harmful emissions, due to the lack of adequate charging infrastructures, underdeveloped power transmission systems, and increased cost of power generation, it is difficult for a developing country to adopt and rely heavily on EVs. However, developing countries like Bangladesh can adopt a different strategy to address this issue. Harmful emission reduction is also possible by transitioning from conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The drivers that can promote the expansion of HEV adoption have not been extensively studied to date, which inspired the proposed study. This study explores the drivers for the growth of HEV adoption in emerging economies. First, the study identifies seventeen drivers from the literature review and expert feedback. Then the identified drivers were assessed using the Bayesian Best-Worst method (BWM). The study findings indicate that no requirement for a charging station, incentivizing consumers through policy measures, and enhanced fuel efficiency are the top three drivers influencing the growth of HEV adoption in developing or emerging economies. This study can help the decision-makers and end users in developing counties to gradually shift towards a low-carbon emission-based economy and ensure a greener and more sustainable future. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Supply chain plays an important role in the efficiency of providing products and services. This category is becoming more important in the oil industry, which is one of the competitive advantages of the country, and its development can create a lot of currency and employment for the country's economy. Methodology: The present research is applied in terms of orientation and exploratory in terms of purpose. Also, the philosophical foundations of research, pragmatism and its methodology are mixed. To conduct the research in the first stage, by reviewing the literature and interviewing oil industry experts, 16 key drivers of the research were extracted. After screening, 8 factors were removed by statistical tests and the rest of the factors were evaluated by Cross Impact Analysis technique. Findings: Based on the degree of effectiveness, the two drivers of government financing policies and oil companies' plans to improve and upgrade oil equipment were selected as important drivers for mapping oil industry supply chain scenarios. Originality/Value: Based on these two drivers, four scenarios of opportunistic supply chain, resource-oriented supply chain, new supply chain and old supply chain were mapped. According to the four criteria for evaluating scenarios in terms of probability of occurrence and application of CODAS technique, the opportunistic supply chain scenario was selected as the most probable scenario. © 2022, Research Expansion Alliance (REA).

Then, a multi-energy storage system is established for flexible regulation according to the fluctuating demand of multi-energy in MEMG. Considering the uncertainties of biomass waste production by residents, renewable energy output, and multi-energy load, a MEMG multi-objective robust optimal scheduling model is established with the objectives of minimizing operating costs and maximizing waste disposal. Finally, a numerical example simulation is carried out with a MEMG in Northeast China. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and economics of the MEMG integrated biomass waste treatment facility through different comparison scenarios, which can realize the effective integration of energy consumption and environmental friendliness. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The development and application of emerging technologies of Industry 4.0 enable the realization of digital twins (DT), which facilitates the transformation of the manufacturing sector to a more agile and intelligent one. DTs are virtual constructs of physical systems that mirror the behavior and dynamics of such physical systems. A fully developed DT consists of physical components, virtual components, and information communications between the two. Integrated DTs are being applied in various processes and product industries. Although the pharmaceutical industry has evolved recently to adopt Quality-by-Design (QbD) initiatives and is undergoing a paradigm shift of digitalization to embrace Industry 4.0, there has not been a full DT application in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Therefore, there is a critical need to examine the progress of the pharmaceutical industry towards implementing DT solutions. The aim of this narrative literature review is to give an overview of the current status of DT development and its application in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturing. State-of-the-art Process Analytical Technology (PAT) developments, process modeling approaches, and data integration studies are reviewed. Challenges and opportunities for future research in this field are also discussed. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication models are of great importance and are valuable tools for the development of policy and legislation. However, the parameter uncertainty and substantial computational cost lead to difficulties in decision-making, especially for complex models with multiple indicators. A multicriteria uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation (MUAPE) method, which selected behavioral parameters combined with Pareto domination and simultaneously obtained acceptable values for modeling by the maximum likelihood concept and kernel density estimation, was shown. This method, which did not assign thresholds and weights, was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the Chaohu Lake eutrophication model and estimate parameters. The results of the behavioral parameters were compared using different criterion sets, the relative error (RE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), and the results showed little discrepancy in terms of the effects on parameter uncertainty represented by the marginal probability density. The uncertainties of the parameters related to algal kinetics (i.e., BMR, PM, and KESS) were smaller than those of nutrient- and temperature-related parameters (i.e., KDN, Nitm, KTB, and KTHDR) for both sets of criteria. However, the reduction in the joint uncertainty of the two parameters was greater when RE was used than when RMSE was used. The acceptable values for the key parameters of the Chaohu Lake eutrophication model were also obtained by the RE criterion. The results strongly agreed with the observed values, and parameters could be applied for model prediction. This result indicated that the combination method was not only practical for reducing parameter uncertainty but also useful for determining parameter values. This method provides a basis for multicriteria uncertainty analysis and parameter estimation in eutrophication modeling. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The results reveal two stable periods of annual publications, from 2000 to 2002 with an average rate of 27, and from 2003 to 2010 with a value of 51; and a period with an increasing production rate of 20 publications per year after 2010. According to the document-type distribution, articles and conference papers have almost the same contribution. The most productive country was the United States, followed by Canada and China. The research trend in the field of pavement management could be grouped into three main areas. The first one is related to pavement management systems, which attracted the greatest attention, especially optimization processes with various objectives and lifecycle cost analysis. The second group is about pavement performance modeling, where calibration of mechanical empirical models was largely developed. Lastly, data collection had also occupied several papers, mainly about cracking classification. Sustainability aspects in pavement management became an emergent issue. The trending issues in that period, in these categories, were summarized in the paper. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {There has been an increased interest in resilient supplier selection in recent years, much of it focusing on forecasting the disruption probabilities. We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience. The proposed data-driven decision-making model for resilient supplier selection can be further exploited for design of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain disruption management models, re-designing the supplier base or investing in most important and risky suppliers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.

To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response).

First, goal and criteria or attribute for achieving NDC through the freight sector are identified. Next, expert opinions from transport and climate change specialists  are sought. Lastly, results and insights related to the most feasible alternatives, such as heavy road, heavy rail, hybrid, heavy waterborne, and heavy air with regard to the select attributes and its sub-attributes viz, slower growth, structural changes in sector and economy, strategic and operational choices, technology and innovation and regulatory and economic instruments with the help of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) are drawn.

	abstract = {Ecosystem services, as a bridge connecting natural and social ecosystems, are important tools for social-ecological system management and analysis. Ecosystem services tradeoff researches focus on the cognition and regulation of the relationship between ecosystem services, which plays an important role in coordinating multiple goals, maximizing human well-being, and supporting the sustainable use of social-ecological system. This paper summarizes the connotation and classification of ecosystem service tradeoff, divides ecosystem service tradeoff research into two categories; objective tradeoff law and management tradeoff decision, and systematically reviews the domestic and international progress of the research content, ideas and methods of ecosystem service tradeoff. In terms of objective tradeoff law, it mainly includes tradeoff relationship between ecosystem service supply and demand, and tradeoff relationship between ecosystem service supply or demand. Tradeoff relationship between ecosystem service supply and demand includes matching dimensions and matching research methods. Tradeoff relationship between ecosystem service supply or demand includes relationship recognition and driving force analysis. In the aspect of management tradeoff decision, it mainly includes the criterion determination and the problem-solving ideas. In the end, the overall evaluation and research prospect of the progress at home and abroad were made. At present, the research on objective tradeoff law is relatively mature, and following the supply side, the tradeoff research on the demand side of ecosystem service also gradually increased, but there remains some problems such as unclear application direction and insufficient robustness of research results. In the researches of management tradeoff decision, it is easy to ignore the setting of decision criterion, which makes the feasibility of the result doubtful. We suggested that the research paradigm of ecosystem service tradeoff needed to integrate the objective tradeoff law and management tradeoff decision, to make the objective tradeoff law researches more application oriented. In terms of the exploration of objective laws, we should deepen the research on the driving mechanism that forms the law of tradeoffs, carry out the research on the coupling of multiple space-time scales, and clarify the robustness of the law of tradeoffs. In the aspect of tradeoff decision management, it should attach importance to the setting of decision-making criteria, strengthen the participation of multiple parties in decision-making, and deeply explore the relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being, so as to make the tradeoff criteria more close to the real needs of regional management and improve the feasibility of decision-making results. In the aspect of empirical research, the research of trade-offs decision paid insufficient attention to Chinese protected areas. In the future, we should try to fill the research gap of the protected areas while continuing to promote the study of urban areas, to serve the urgent tradeoff management needs of the protected areas in China. © 2021 Science Press.

	abstract = {The benefits of renewable energy are that it is sustainable and is low in environmental pollution. Growing load requirement, global warming, and energy crisis need energy-intensive management to give sincere attempts to promote high accuracy energy monitoring techniques in order to enhance energy system efficiency and performance. The energy consumption data of domestic, commercial and industrial are becoming accessible to estimate the notable share of various sectors in the energy market. Energy forecasting algorithms play a vital role in energy sector development and policy formulation. Energy prediction and power supply management are the key roots of energy planning. A large number of prediction models have been used in the recent past. The selection of a prediction model usually based on available data, the objectives of the model network mechanism and energy planning operation. In this review, we conduct a critical and systematic review of renewable energy and electricity prediction models applied as an energy planning tool. The forecasting intervals is divided into three sections including: i) short-term; ii) medium-term; iii) and long-term. Three renewable energy resources, i.e. wind, solar, and geothermal energy, and electricity load demand requirement are considered for review forecasting analysis. Three major states-of-art forecasting classifications: i) machine learning algorithms; ii) ensemble-based approaches; iii) and artificial neural networks are analyzed. These approaches are investigated for prediction applicability; accuracy for spatial and temporal forecasting; and relevance to policy and planning objectives. The machine learning models can handle large amount of data with accurate forecasting analysis. Applying ensemble techniques enables us to obtain higher forecasting accuracy by combining different models. Artificial neural networks if used in the right way can contribute a robust choice, given that it is capible to extract and model unseen relationships and features. Furthermore, unlike these conventional techniques, artificial neural networks do not force any limitation on residual and input distributions. Findings from this review would help professionals and researchers in obtaining recognition of the prediction approaches and allow them to choose the relevant methods to satisfy their desired tasks and forecasting requirements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The nature of supply chains presents a variety of issues related to uncertainties. Under various uncertainties, risk management plays a crucial role in an effective supply chain decision-making. The uncertainty involved in the risk assessment process can be divided into two types: random uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Fuzzy theory has been applied to deal with uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role and contribution of the fuzzy logic in the treatment of epistemic uncertainty into supply chain risk management approaches. A literature review process was performed, followed by analysis and discussions on the examined topic. The results revealed that the integration with multicriteria decision-making and disruptive analysis methods are the most common types adopted, with trend to petri nets and multicriteria decision-making approaches. Supply risks are the most studied type and identification and assessment are the most developed processes in supply chain risk management. Although the publications on the subject has been highlighted, they present some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment and the reliability of the background knowledge in the assessment. In that sense, these remarks reveal interesting future researches lines. © 2020, Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association.},

Success of CCP depends on accurate transcription of uncertain parameter space for correct estimation of statistical measures, e.g. probability, which is challenging in practical scenarios, where the data available is sparse and difficult to fit using known statistical distributions. To tackle this situation, a novel Data based Intelligent Sampling strategies for CCP (DISC) has been proposed amalgamating the machine learning techniques with novel Fuzzy C-means algorithm. It identifies the data clusters in the sparse uncertain parameter space followed by sampling strictly inside those clusters using the Sobol scheme, which is often not accurately performed by the conventional techniques. Ten parameters depicting uncertainties in the model and feed stream have been considered for optimizing conflicting objectives of productivity, quality and energy savings. A comprehensive comparison displays 42 and 34% improvements over the conventional box and budget sampling techniques, respectively, demonstrating efficacy of the proposed technique. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {While Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) has provided many methods and tools for solving design problems, food processes have benefitted little from them. MOO encompasses the identification of performance indicators, process modelling, preference integration, trade-off assessment, and finding the best trade-offs. In this review, the use of these five elements in the design of food processes through MOO is analysed. A number of studies dealing with food processes MOO have been identified. Even though these studies improve the design process, they often approach MOO in a simplified and insufficiently rationalized way. Based on this review, several research issues are identified, related to the improvement of the different models and methods, and to the development of more holistic MOO methods for food processes. Background: The challenge of food process engineering, taking into account the many constraints, is becoming increasingly difficult. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) has provided many methods and tools to solve design problems, which often entail conflicting objectives (e.g. product quality vs. profit). Thus, only a trade-off can result from the design process, where preferences and weighting of the conflicting objectives has to be included. Scope and approach: In this review, MOO methods used in food process design studies are analysed through the framework of the five elements which constitute a MOO method: i) performance indicators to quantify the design objectives; ii) a predictive process model to evaluate the different design solutions; iii) decision-maker and/or expert preferences, expressed as weights of the different objectives and satisfaction levels on indicator values; iv) a selection method to select one or several “best” trade-offs; v) an optimization algorithm to find the best design solutions among the feasible ones. Key findings and conclusions: The authors highlight the fact that more holistic MOO methods can be used to improve the design process, as numerous methods have been developed to build MOO methods, particularly in the field of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The literature reveals that MOO is often approached in a simplified and insufficiently rationalized way, which hinders the use of MCDM methods to improve the design process. Several research issues are also identified, related to the improvement of the different models and methods, which could help develop more holistic MOO methods for food processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increasing pressure from governments and stakeholders has motivated the study of sustainability assessment in the supply chain context at operational, tactical, and strategic levels. Several papers have been published during the last two decades, and the number is still rising. Although several authors present complex models that include environmental and social assessment, the applicability and usefulness of these works is often limited by lack of data availability and lack of consensus in what is to be measured on implementations of sustainable practices and strategies. This paper presents a systematic literature review of works addressing the supply chain network design (SCND) problem, in which at least two of the three dimensions of sustainability are assessed. This paper aims to identify indicators that are used when sustainability is evaluated in real applied cases. A total of 113 papers from 2015 to 2018 were selected, including documents studying forward, reverse, and closed loop supply chains (CLSC). Indicators in the economic, environmental, and social dimensions were classified according to an existing framework in the sustainable supply chain literature. The review finds a highlighted emphasis on environmental considerations; social criteria are still hardly studied. The study country origin analysis also shows an increasing concern for sustainable practices in developing economies, mainly in Asia. Finally, this paper presents a brief description of the areas where research opportunities exist, including sectors, measures, and methodologies to assess sustainability in the SCND problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Various types of risks exist in a supply chain, and disruptions could lead to economic loss or even breakdown of a supply chain without an effective mitigation strategy. The ability to detect disruptions early can help improve the resilience of the supply chain. In this paper, the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic PCA (DPCA) in fault detection and diagnosis of a supply chain system is investigated. In order to monitor the supply chain, data such as inventory levels, market demands, and amount of products in transit are collected. PCA and DPCA are used to model the normal operating conditions (NOC). Two monitoring statistics, the Hotelling's T2 and the squared prediction error (SPE), are used to detect abnormal operation of the supply chain. The confidence limits of these two statistics are estimated from the training data based on the χ2-distributions. The contribution plots are used to identify the variables with abnormal behavior when at least one statistic exceeds its limit. Two case studies are presented - a multi-echelon supply chain for a single product that includes a manufacturing process and a gas bottling supply chain with multiple products. In order to validate the proposed method, supply chain simulation models are developed using the programming language Python 3.7, and simulated data is collected for analysis. PCA and DPCA are applied to the data using the scikit-learn machine learning library for Python. The results show that abnormal operation due to transportation delay, supply shortage, and poor manufacturing yield can be detected. The contribution plots are useful for interpreting and identifying the abnormality.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

Not controlling such disasters brings about severe disruptions in the supply chains and communities and, thereby, irreparable losses will come into play. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is inherent in the supply chains nature. In the context of various uncertainties, risk management plays a crucial role in effective supply chain management. The uncertainty involved in the risk assessment process can be divided into two types: random uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. The fuzzy theory has been applied to address uncertainties in this context. The purpose of this paper is to develop a literature review of the major contributions of fuzzy logic in addressing uncertainty in supply chain risk management approaches. The results revealed that integration with disruptive analysis tools and multi-criteria decision-making methods are the most common types adopted, with the increasing trend of Petri nets and Bayesian approaches. The reviewed literature highlights some limitations related to the holistic complexity of risks in supply chains, the dynamic nature of the environment, and the reliability of the knowledge base in the assessment. In that sense, these observations reveal interesting future lines of research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The physical flow of products in traditional supply chains is replaced by the digital flow of information in DSCs. This digitalization has changed the conventional supplier selection processes. We propose an integrated and comprehensive fuzzy multicriteria model for supplier selection in DSCs. The proposed model integrates the fuzzy best-worst method (BWM) with the fuzzy multi-objective optimization based on ratio analysis plus full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA), fuzzy complex proportional assessment of alternatives (COPRAS), and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The fuzzy BWM approach is used to measure the importance weights of the digital criteria. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA, fuzzy COPRAS, and fuzzy TOPSIS methods are used as prioritization methods to rank the suppliers. The maximize agreement heuristic (MAH) is used to aggregate the supplier rankings obtained from the prioritization methods into a consensus ranking. We present a real-world case study in a manufacturing company to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. © 2021},

First, the paper elaborates on the basic concepts of Nash and Stackelberg games to allow further understanding of their applications in supply chain analysis. The review is then presented and divided into three segments: 1) the development of game theory; 2) the use of Nash and Stackelberg solution concepts in analysing supply chain management; 3) the integration of game theory to different supply chain structures, decisions, and present conditions. Moreover, descriptive analytics are also provided to highlight the distribution of trending topics in the domain field.

A robust optimization model to define production, storage and hedging strategies is proposed. Uncertainty sets on returns are constructed based on a state space model (Kalman Filter). The presented model was applied to Brazilian ethanol and sugar markets in different economic scenarios. The study analyses efficient frontiers and optimal strategies and the results indicate that, even adopting good price forecast models, the optimal strategies can be deeply affected by uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Supplier selection is a critical decision with sustainability impacts in global supply chain. This study explores how different dimensions of a supplier's sustainability can affect managers' evaluation and consequent selection of a supplier. An experimental research method is applied to examine a series of hypotheses that integrate the sustainable supply chain management literature and the behavioural decision-making literature. Data from a total of 857 valid sets of responses in three scenario-based experiments were used to explore the impacts of long-term and short-term relationships with the supplier, and the length of work experience of the supply chain manager as factors in managers' selection decisions. The findings show that managers favour sustainability dimensions in their evaluation and intention to select a supplier. Moreover, managers react more negatively to a low level of sustainability than they react positively to a high level of sustainability. The economic dimension of sustainability has the strongest impact of the three dimensions on managers' supplier evaluation and selection intent. Furthermore, where the manager and supplier have been in a long-term relationship, there is an interaction effect between managers support for each of the dimensions and the effect of sustainability on supplier evaluation and selection. However, this moderating effect is less significant in a short-term relationship and becomes insignificant after accounting for the impact of length of work experience of the decision-makers. The experimental research approach and results provide managerial implications for effective allocation of resources, as well as policy suggestions for the broader operations and supply chain systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sustainable Supply Chain have become a cornerstone to any company that seeks to achieve sustainable goals. A company's image is no longer related to the old paradigm of being sustainable in its own activities, but instead is associated with a strong collaboration between all supply chain stakeholders, towards a sustainable activity. It is then critical to create new methods and tools to account for the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental and social, in a multi-stakeholder chain. In this context, operational research (OR) methods play a key role in supporting sustainable supply chain activities. This paper aims to review the trends and directions of OR methods applications towards the achievement of sustainable supply chain. A set of 220 papers has been reviewed to identify the OR methods being employed, the levels of decision considered and how sustainability practices were treated through OR. We found that optimization models applied to strategic level decisions are the most preponderant studies. Moreover, it was verified that sustainability has been mainly tackled by assessing economic and environmental aspects, leaving behind the social aspects. Additionally, OR-based studies do not yet present a clear definition of sustainability, a fact that is proven by the number of environmental and social methodologies explored. Based on the major trends identified in the literature, a research framework is derived, pointing towards a future research agenda in the area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the uncertain interference events, especially sudden changes of machine state, and the improvement of processing quality are ignored in green scheduling. They result in the current green scheduling is one-sided for green manufacturing. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated method for intelligent green scheduling of the sustainable flexible workshop with edge computing considering uncertain machine state. Firstly, a multi-objective model for green scheduling is built and solved with the makespan, processing cost, processing quality and energy consumption as its optimisation objectives. Then, a hardware system for intelligent monitoring and diagnosis of machine state is established based on wireless sensor network (WSN), edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the diagnosis results of machine state provide feedback to the original green scheduling scheme and the corresponding real-time adjustment called green rescheduling is conducted to response to uncertain dynamic machine state. A case study of intelligent green scheduling where several machines fall into fault operation suddenly is employed to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method, and it is compared with other multi-objective optimisation algorithms for green scheduling. The results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the rivals on this issue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Extreme events cause significant damage and disruption to the manufacturing sector, associated supply chains, and adjacent communities. These disastrous shocks may include natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, floods, earthquakes), pandemics, catastrophic economic collapses (e.g., price crash of oil and gas), and terrorist and cyberattacks. Although much research has addressed the resilience of infrastructure, very little work has targeted the resilience of the manufacturing processes. Even less work has addressed the topic of process design approaches to create disaster-resilient industrial processes. The objective of this paper is to provide perspectives on the use of process integration for developing disaster-resilient designs of industrial plants with a focus on the process industries (e.g., chemical, petrochemical, oil, gas, specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biorefining). Focus is given to three categories of extreme events: natural disasters, pandemics, and economic collapses. Although several principles have been proposed for resilience engineering of infrastructure, industrial processes have unique features that warrant a tailored discussion. To streamline the discussion, we have identified 12 principal strategies for creating disaster-resilient designs: (1) Fail-safe by design, (2) Redundancy, (3) Reconfigurability, (4) Modularity/Mobility/Distributability, (5) Repurposability, (6) Flexibility, (7) Controllability, (8) Reliability, (9) Recoverability/restorability, (10) Rapidity, (11) Robustness, and (12) Resourcefulness. These strategies are generally applicable to the process industries because they transcend the specific type of the manufacturing facility. Examples of industrial applications are given to explain the resilience strategies and discuss the research challenges and potential use of process integration in the systematic development of design concepts and tools for resilient design. The paper concludes with a list of future directions and promising research opportunities. Copyright © 2020 El-Halwagi, Sengupta, Pistikopoulos, Sammons, Eljack and Kazi.},

	abstract = {Based on a simulated annealing algorithm, this study empirically determined the optimal stand-level forest management strategies for the Miyun Reservoir Catchment (MRC), the important protective screen and ecosystem service provider for Beijing City. The optimization results of wood provisioning indicate that the objective yield can be more effectively and sustainably attained over longer planning horizons. In terms of carbon sequestration service, the slowed growth rate or capacity in the longer planning horizons was associated with a growing proportion of old-growth forest results in an adverse change from carbon sink to source. Given the integrated forest management scenarios combined with the above two objectives, the total carbon sequestration service consisting of growing and harvesting stocks is positively correlated with the wood provisioning service over the longer planning horizons when based on an assumption of no carbon leakage (i.e., synergy). Similar variation trends are also reflected in the aspect of related economic value. Therefore, a set of longer-term integrated forest management strategies combined with wood and carbon services, as well as their values, should be applied to balance the supply of different services over the long term, to guide short-term adaptive management tactics integrated with close-to-nature forest management technology, and to fundamentally alter decisions regarding optimal ecosystem services for megacities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the rapid surge of renewable energy integrations into the electrical grid, the main questions remain; how do we manage and operate optimally these surges of fluctuating resources? However, vast optimization approaches in renewable energy applications have been widely used hitherto to aid decision-makings in mitigating the limitations of computations. This paper comprehensively reviews the generic steps of stochastic optimizations in renewable energy applications, from the modelling of the uncertainties and sampling of relevant information, respectively. Furthermore, the benefits and drawbacks of the stochastic optimization methods are highlighted. Moreover, notable optimization methods pertaining to the steps of stochastic optimizations are highlighted. The aim of the paper is to introduce the recent advancements and notable stochastic methods and trending of the methods going into the future of renewable energy applications. Relevant future research areas are identified to support the transition of stochastic optimizations from the traditional deterministic approaches. We concluded based on the surveyed literatures that the stochastic optimization methods almost always outperform the deterministic optimization methods in terms of social, technical, and economic aspects of renewable energy systems. Thus, this review will catalyse the effort in advancing the research of stochastic optimization methods within the scopes of renewable energy applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Herein we report the implementation of a new multi-objective machine learning optimization algorithm for self-optimization, and demonstrate it in two exemplar chemical reactions performed in continuous flow. The algorithm successfully identified a set of optimal conditions corresponding to the trade-off curve (Pareto front) between environmental and economic objectives in both cases. Thus, it reveals the complete underlying trade-off and is not limited to one compromise as is the case in many other studies. The machine learning algorithm proved to be extremely data efficient, identifying the optimal conditions for the objectives in a lower number of experiments compared to single-objective optimizations. The complete underlying trade-off between multiple objectives is identified without arbitrary weighting factors, but via true multi-objective optimization. © 2018},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has risen to prominence based on its promise to vastly improve environmental decision-making and to represent nature's many benefits to people. Yet the field has continued to be plagued by fundamental concerns, leading some to believe that the field of ES must mature or be replaced. In this paper, we quantitatively survey a stratified random sample of more than 1,000 articles addressing ES across three decades of scholarship. Our purpose is to examine the field's attention to common critiques regarding insufficient credible valuations of realistic changes to services; an unjustified preoccupation with monetary valuation; and too little social and policy research (e.g. questions of access to and demand for services). We found that very little of the ES literature includes valuation of biophysical change (2.4%), despite many biophysical studies of services (24%). An initially small but substantially rising number of papers address crucial policy (14%) and social dimensions, including access, demand and the social consequences of change (5.8%). As well, recent years have seen a significant increase in non-monetary valuation (from 0% to 2.5%). Ecosystem service research has, we summarize, evolved in meaningful ways. But some of its goals remain unmet, despite the promise to improve environmental decisions, in part because of a continued pre-occupation with numerical valuation often without appropriate biophysical grounding. Here we call for a next generation of research: Integrative biophysical-social research that characterizes ES change, and is coupled with multi-metric and qualitative valuation, and context-appropriate decision-making.

Understanding the impact of forest management on their supply can inform policy and practice for meeting societal demand. The objectives of this paper are to identify and review the effect of management intensity on priority ES supply and identify synergies and trade-offs among ES of different management approaches. We review seven priority ES identified from UK land and forestry strategy and policy documents: timber/biomass production, carbon storage, biodiversity, health and recreation, water supply and quality and flood protection.We present a synthesis of the impact of management on relative ES supply. It shows that low intensity management is unsuitable for high biomass production, yet provides high or moderately high levels of other services. Higher intensity management impacts negatively on biodiversity, health and recreation and water supply services. Combined objective forestry provides high or moderately high levels for all services except biomass.We recommend that a diversity of management approaches is needed to maintain multiple ecosystem service provision. The ES framework offers opportunities to forest management by revealing areas of conflict or co-production and potential trade-offs that may arise from adjusting management intensity. © Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2017.

	abstract = {The consumption of fossil fuels has exponentially increased in recent decades, despite significant air pollution, environmental deterioration challenges, health problems, and limited resources. Biofuel can be used instead of fossil fuel due to environmental benefits and availability to produce various energy sorts like electricity, power, and heating or to sustain transportation fuels. Biodiesel production is an intricate process that requires identifying unknown nonlinear relationships between the system input and output data; therefore, accurate and swift modeling instruments like machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) are necessary to design, handle, control, optimize, and monitor the system. Among the biodiesel production modeling methods, machine learning provides better predictions with the highest accuracy, inspired by the brain's autolearning and self-improving capability to solve the study's complicated questions; therefore, it is beneficial for modeling (trans) esterification processes, physicochemical properties, and monitoring biodiesel systems in real-time. Machine learning applications in the production phase include quality optimization and estimation, process conditions, and quantity. Emissions composition and temperature estimation and motor performance analysis investigate in the consumption phase. Fatty methyl acid ester stands as the output parameter, and the input parameters include oil and catalyst type, methanol-to-oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time, domain, and frequency. This paper will present a review and discuss various ML technology advantages, disadvantages, and applications in biodiesel production, mainly focused on recently published articles from 2010 to 2021, to make decisions and optimize, model, control, monitor, and forecast biodiesel production. © 2021 Yuanzhi Xing et al.},

	abstract = {The challenges of global economies foster supply chains to have to increase their processes of collaboration and dependence between their nodes, generating an increase in the level of vulnerability to possible impacts and interruptions in their operations that may affect their sustainability. This has developed an emerging area of interest in supply chain management, considering resilience management as a strategic capability of companies, and causing an increase in this area of research. Additionally, supply chains should deal with the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social dimensions) by incorporating the three types of objectives in their strategy. Thus, there is a need to integrate both resilience and sustainability in supply chain management to increase competitiveness. In this paper, a systematic literature review is undertaken to analyze resilience management and its connection to increase supply chain sustainability. In the review, 232 articles published from 2000 to February 2020 in peer-reviewed journals in the Scopus and ScienceDirect databases are analyzed, classified, and synthesized. With the results, this paper develops a conceptual framework that integrates the fundamental elements for analyzing, measuring, and managing resilience to increase sustainability in the supply chain. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and future research lines are exposed. © 2020 by the authors.},

This paper presents a systematic literature review of quantitative models of SCND under disruption risks in industrial SCM and logistics. More specifically, our analysis is focused on different costs induced by the planning of proactive investments in robustness and through parametrical/structural adaptation at the recovery stage. This review can be of value for researchers and decision-makers alike for several reasons. First, we categorise the existing knowledge based on decision-making problems, which can be instructive for a convenient association of a particular SCND problem to a modelling domain according to network-wise, supply-side and demand-side perspectives. Second, our analysis focuses on the costs specifically induced by disruption risks and resilience investments. Third, we offer a dedicated section related to disruption probability formulation methods and their impact on resilience costs. Fourth, the integration of different SCM dimensions (i.e., social impact, environmental impact, responsiveness, and risk-aversion) and the associated multi-objective modelling settings are discussed along with disruption risks in SCND models. Finally, we summarize our findings as insights from a managerial perspective. Drawbacks and missing aspects in the related literature are highlighted, and we lay out several research directions and open questions for future research. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Today, in many organizations, the debate about the difference in core capabilities has become an important factor for market competition. Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented ε-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Energy Internet represents a critical breakthrough which is regarded as the synthetic product of information communication technologies and energy technologies. It is highly conducive to providing possible solutions for transforming energy management methods, reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. The extensive attention of scholars has been drawn to the progress of Energy Internet. However, the multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for Energy Internet considering uncertainty still has some problems. (1) The actual number of optimisation objectives for Energy Internet design is more than two so that it is difficult to adopt conventional intelligence algorithms to solve it. (2) Most intelligence algorithms for double-objective optimisation model are not desirable. (3) The MCDM process of Energy Internet is not considered systematically. To solve these problems, an integrated approach combining improved great deluge algorithm (GDA), evidence reasoning (ER), interval algorithm, and fuzzy grey correlation analysis for multi-objective optimisation and MCDM of Energy Internet considering uncertainty is proposed in this paper. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated by a visual case study of Energy Internet design. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Water transport systems play an essential role in increasing the productivity and efficiency of oilfields. Efforts toward water management and optimal allocation of water resources can help oilfield enterprises move to sustainable and cleaner production. In many oilfields, the water transport system requires both pipelines and trucks to meet the water demand of water injection wells. A method should be proposed to find an optimal strategy for allocating water to wells by these 2 transport modes. In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to minimise total transport and pump operating costs. Water balance, transport capacity and pipeline operation are taken as constraints. The operating plan of the pipeline network and the dispatch plan of trucks can be simultaneously optimised. An oilfield in China is selected as a case study to estimate the potential of this oilfield in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, as well as to optimise its operating plan for the pipeline network and the dispatch plan for trucks. Also, the sensitivity of electricity price, transport price and pipeline diameter are analysed, and the cost and CO2 emissions are compared. The results demonstrate that if the optimal diameter of a pipeline is selected, CO2 emissions can be reduced by 65.07% and the total cost by 25.28%. This method can also be used in other oilfields or other water transport systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the present study, a new mixed-integer linear programming is presented for a reliability-oriented power network. The reliability approach is conducted using the Average Energy Not Supplied (AENS) index and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) based on the feeder's failure rate. In this formulation, the constraints include standard ranges for electric power and current magnitude, acceptable voltage drop, power law, and power balance considering loss power. Moreover, the relation between feeder failure rate and electric power level and subsequently SAIDI for outage duration control is added in constraints to improve network reliability. The model is studied on a real case study in Iran in two scenarios with or without considering DG. The obtained results indicate that optimization for DG location and its capacity in the power system decrease AENS cost. Furthermore, DG incorporation in the grid reduces load congestion in substations and system’ total cost. Augmented Epsilon Constraint (AEC) method is utilized to solve two-objective mixed-integer linear programming. To overcome the uncertain environment, the robust optimization is applied, and the effect of Γ parameters is investigated on Pareto sets and system's total costs. As confirmed by numerical results, by increasing demand constraint conservative level, the objective function gets away from the nominal value, requiring that Decision-Makers create an appropriate balance between conservative levels and system costs. The obtained results reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model in the real world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The availability of bioethanol, a promising renewable alternative to fossil fuels depends on the supply of biomass produced from agricultural resources. The study attempts a system dynamics modelling approach to explore the implications of greenhouse gas concentration trajectories associated with climate change on bioethanol supply chains. Eight different climate change scenarios are simulated spanning over a 40-year horizon to predict biomass yield and bioethanol availability, by considering first generation (corn) and second generation (switchgrass) ethanol feedstocks. The developed model is used to assess the extent of potential disruptions resulting from global warming. Cascading effect of climate change risk is evident through decreased yield and production, and increased shortages at end customer in the bioethanol supply network. The results indicate that, if climate change risk is not adequately mitigated and current used source of ethanol (corn) continues to be leveraged, the bioethanol availability may decrease by one-fourth by the year 2060. The comparative study encourages exploring the increased use of switchgrass as a sustainable feedstock for renewable energy. Developed insights support identifying effective climate change mitigation policies and sustainable investment decisions for the reduction in carbon emissions. © 2020},

	abstract = {The social dimension of sustainability in supply chains has grown in importance in both academic and industrial communities. This article aims to understand how social dimension has been incorporated in supply chain management research in the past years and what research gaps still exist. For this purpose, a systematic literature review is performed where 621 articles are analysed considering a set of categories that include: research methodology; social dimension; social analysis focus; supply chain entities; traceability and transparency; uncertainty and risk; industrial activity sector. A cross-analysis between categories is presented, revealing that social sustainability concerns have been increasingly addressed along the years, but further research still needs to be performed to achieve more inclusive social supply chains. N-Vivo Software is used to perform the content analysis. The main research gaps and trends regarding social concerns in supply chains are identified and systematised into a framework that can be used to integrate social aspects in supply chains. Based on the latter, a research agenda is defined targeting concerned researchers and practitioners to attain the sustainable supply chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Palm oil is a renewable resource that has the potential to replace fossil fuel and petrochemical for a better sustainable system. However, there is room for improvement in the current operation of the palm oil industry to achieve better sustainability development. The industrial revolution toward automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is the new trend known as the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Unfortunately, the palm oil industry has been moving slowly in this revolution. This paper aims to conduct a detailed review of the current state of the palm oil industry development toward Industry 4.0. A novel Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) approach is adopted i) to ensure a detailed evaluation of the existing problems, and ii) to identify potential implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the palm oil industry. HAZOP is a common approach used in chemical engineering to systematically evaluate process safety and identify the possible improvement of the existing system. The same concept is applied in this paper to investigate the possible adaptation of Industry 4.0 technologies to improve the palm oil industry. Existing Industry 4.0 technologies and features were evaluated to identify feasible adaptation in the industry. The HAZOP review proposed 23 recommendations to improve the palm oil industry with Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve a higher standard in sustainable production. A total of 13 specific Industry 4.0 features were identified as the potential development gaps for palm oil industry stakeholders, which included the adaptation of Internet-of-Things sensors, cloud computing, blockchain, and smart imaging processing technologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, an interval-stochastic basic-possibilistic programming (ISBPP) method is developed for planning sustainable energy system (SES). ISBPP cannot only reflect multiple uncertainties expressed as interval-possibilistic variables and interval-stochastic-possibilistic parameters, but also facilitate analyzing tradeoff between economic objective and pollutant mitigation. The ISBPP method is then applied to planning the SES of Beijing, where different power sources for electric vehicles (EVs) are analyzed. Solutions in association with different demand levels, power sources and confidence levels have been generated. Results reveal that uncertainties existed in the system components (e.g., fuel/electricity price, capacity-expansion option, electricity demand, and vehicle ownership) have significant effects on the outputs of decision variables and system cost. Results disclose that ISBPP can provide effective supports for decision makers to achieve desired SES planning schemes with the introduction of EVs. Results also imply that reforming fossil-based energy system to a sustainable one needs both financial incentives and governmental policies on energetically developing renewable energies. Findings can help decision makers achieve the desired sustainable scheme through in-depth analysis of tradeoffs among system cost and environmental pollution control as well as EVs stimulation degree. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Short-term wind speed forecasting is crucial to enhance the operational efficiency and increase the economic benefit of wind power generation systems. A substantial number of studies were conducted to enhance wind speed forecasting. Combined models are increasingly being preferred, as they always yield better results. However, the current combined models either do not fully consider the different characteristics hidden in the wind speed series or are restricted by the difficulties in modeling very unstable and irregular data, which leads to a limited forecasting enhancement. To overcome the limitation of the current combined models and provide a more reliable wind speed prediction, this study proposes an efficient combined forecasting system that innovatively adopts a more advanced multi-layer cooperative combined strategy, which inherits the strengths of the conventional combined strategies while simultaneously avoiding some of their limitations. It successfully overcomes some drawbacks of some current models, for example, low accuracy and high instability, and significantly improve the forecasting performance. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed system is superior to other single or combined methods, as it can always obtain a higher forecasting accuracy and stability. It can offer a practical method to forecast wind speed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As the demand for food grows continuously, intelligent agriculture has drawn much attention due to its capability of producing great quantities of food efficiently. The main purpose of intelligent agriculture is to plan agricultural missions properly and use limited resources reasonably with minor human intervention. This paper proposes a Precision Farming System (PFS) as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Components of PFS are treated as agents with different functionalities. These agents could form several coalitions to complete the complex agricultural missions cooperatively. In PFS, mission planning should consider several criteria, like expected benefit, energy consumption or equipment loss. Hence, mission planning could be treated as a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP). In order to solve MOP, an improved algorithm, MP-PSOGA, is proposed, taking advantages of the Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization. A simulation, called precise pesticide spraying mission, is performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach works properly. This approach enables the PFS to plan missions and allocate scarce resources efficiently. The theoretical analysis and simulation is a good foundation for the future study. Once the proposed approach is applied to a real scenario, it is expected to bring significant economic improvement. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Computational and statistical tools help manage the prevailing challenges of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing meticulous understanding of contemporary issues. However, complex challenges are difficult to handle with conventional techniques, resulting to the need for more advanced methods. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often used as an advanced approach in modelling complex behaviour of systems. Evaluating the current utilization of ANNs helps researchers gauge their applicability to SDG-related issues. The gaps among the studied SDGs need to be addressed through a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature. Hence, this work reviews published journal articles on the application of ANNs in resolving issues of the SDGs. This review identifies the current trends and limitations of ANN for SDG, and discusses its prominent applications and field of utilization. Descriptive and content analysis of journal articles is performed for this review. Journal articles from the Scopus database reveal Clean Water and Sanitation, Affordable and Clean Energy, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Responsible Consumption and Production are the most popular subject matter for modelling and forecasting. New innovative functions include feature selection, kriging, and simulation. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive mapping of the current state of this area of research. This work aims to aid future researchers to recognize further possible uses of ANNs with respect to the SDGs.

The limited number of studies summarizing important themes and approaches used in this area constrain the ability of scholars and practitioners to initiate or incorporate ecosystem services in their own domains of research. This paper develops a structured process that traces efforts in this domain of knowledge and proposes a systematic review of key themes and approaches that have developed over the last 40 years. Further, this study identifies emerging and dominant areas of interest in the field. Key themes represent underlying meanings or ideas widely used in the ecosystem services field and includes trending or rising topics. Approaches include tools, frameworks, perspectives and management strategies to analyze, assess, and quantify ecosystem services. Analyses showed that, among key themes, conservation of biodiversity and landscape planning had the most activity and interest. Among approaches, economic valuation showed the highest levels of activity, while conceptual framework was the most cited. This review paper contributes a guide to progress in ecosystem service research and provides a comprehensive understanding of its evolution and development. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in novel gene-editing tools such as RNAi, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR-Cas9, the possibility of altering microalgae toward designed properties for various application is becoming a reality. Alteration of microalgae genomes can modify metabolic pathways to give elevated yields in lipids, biomass, and other components. The potential of such genetically optimized microalgae can give a “domino effect” in further providing optimization leverages down the supply chain, in aspects such as cultivation, processing, system design, process integration, and revolutionary products. However, the current level of understanding the functional information of various microalgae gene sequences is still primitive and insufficient as microalgae genome sequences are long and complex. From this perspective, this work proposes to link up this knowledge gap between microalgae genetic information and optimized bioproducts using Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the recent acceleration of AI research, large and complex data from microalgae research can be properly analyzed by combining the cutting-edge of both fields. In this work, the most suitable class of AI algorithms (such as active learning, semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning) are discussed for different cases of microalgae applications. This work concisely reviews the current state of the research milestones and highlight some of the state-of-art that has been carried out, providing insightful future pathways. The utilization of AI algorithms in microalgae cultivation, system optimization, and other aspects of the supply chain is also discussed. This work opens the pathway to a digitalized future for microalgae research and applications. © 2020},

	abstract = {Current food system evolved in a great degree because of the development of processing and food engineering technologies: people learned to bake bread long before the advent of agriculture; salting and smoking supported nomad lifestyles; canning allowed for longer military marches; etc. Food processing technologies went through evolution and significant optimization and currently rely on minor fraction of energy comparing with initial prototypes. Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions. However, new food systems rely on low technology readiness levels and estimation of their potential future benefits or drawbacks is a complex task mostly due to the lack of integrated data. The research is aimed for the development of conceptual guidelines of food production system structuring as cyber-physical systems. The study indicates that cyber-physical nature of modern food is a key for the engineering of more nutritious and sustainable paths for novel food systems. Implementation of machine learning methods for the collection, integration, and analysis of data associated with biomass production and processing on different levels from molecular to global, leads to the precise analysis of food systems and estimation of upscaling benefits, as well as possible negative rebound effects associated with societal attitude. Moreover, such data-integrated assessment systems allow transparency of chains, integration of nutritional and environmental properties, and construction of personalized nutrition technologies. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Medicine unreliability problem is taken into consideration as one of the most important issues in health supply chain management. This research is associated with the development of a multiobjective optimization problem for the selection of suppliers and distributors. To achieve the purposes, the optimal quota allocation is determined with respect to disruption of suppliers in a five-echelon supply chain network and consideration of the distributor centers as a hub location-allocation mode. The objective of the optimization model is involved in simultaneous minimization of transactions costs dealing with suppliers, expected purchasing costs from suppliers, expected percentages of delayed and returned products in each distributor, as well as transportation cost in each echelon and fixed cost for distributor centers, and finally maximization of the expected scores for suppliers and high priority of product customers. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The proposed optimization model is utilized to investigate a numerical case study for asthma-specific medicines. The analyzing procedure is conducted based on the collected real data from Cobel Darou pharmaceutical company in 2019. Furthermore, a fuzzy multichoice goal programming model is considered to solve the proposed optimization model by R optimization solver. The numerical results confirmed the authenticity of the model.  © 2021 Farnaz Javadi Gargari et al.},

	abstract = {Process systems engineering research focuses on the planning, design, operation, and safety of process systems rather than unit operations. In response to the rapid growth of the chemical process industry in the last 20 years in China, advanced system integration and process safety technologies are investigated and applied for better resource utilization, less environmental impact, and safer working places. In this regard, the review in this article consists of four main achievements: (1) process synthesis, (2) energy system integration, (3) water system integration, and (4) process safety management. The purpose of process synthesis and integration is to improve resource and energy utilization, at the same time lowering by-products and emissions. Optimization is conducted on process structure and operation, following the principles of resource coupling and energy cascade utilization. Typical examples are coupling of coal and hydrogen-rich resources and integration of coal-based polygeneration process of chemicals, electricity, and heat. Energy integration implements the coordinated optimization of total site energy systems. Reviews are made on specific methodologies based on the thermodynamics and applications of design and retrofit in ethylene, oil refining, and synthetic ammonia industries. There are energy savings by 10%-20% and yields increasing by 20%-30%. In addition, waste heat recovery and cold energy utilization are also important research areas. Reviews on the progress of water system integration and its industrial applications are also conducted. It includes the direct reuse, regeneration, and reuse/recycle in water systems and systems with internal water mains. Finally, safety management and technologies are also indispensable technological advancements of the process. The legislation system and the work safety-related standard system have been gradually established and enforced. Process safety research progress is reviewed, and questions are proposed for improving the accident prevention and safety management agenda. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {To stay competitive in a business environment, continuous performance evaluation based on the triple bottom line standard of sustainability is necessary. There is a gap in addressing the computational expense caused by increased decision units due to increasing the performance evaluation indices to more accuracy in the evaluation. We successfully addressed these two gaps through (1) using principal component analysis (PCA) to cut the number of evaluation indices, and (2) since PCA itself has the problem of merely using the data distribution without considering the domain-related knowledge, we utilized Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to rank the indices through the expert's domain-related knowledge. We propose an integrated approach for sustainability performance assessment in qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Fourteen insurance companies were evaluated using eight economic, three environmental, and four social indices. The indices were ranked by expert judgment though an analytical hierarchy process as subjective weighting, and then principal component analysis as objective weighting was used to reduce the number of indices. The obtained principal components were then used as variables in the data envelopment analysis model. So, subjective and objective evaluations were integrated. Finally, for validating the results, Spearman and Kendall's Tau correlation tests were used. The results show that Dana, Razi, and Dey had the best sustainability performance. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Industrial energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction (ECCER) management is a multi-objective optimization problem with multiple uncertainty factors. However, most studies have used deterministic optimization approaches, and neglected the uncertainty factors that affect the effectiveness of the management strategies. This study adopts a multi-objective optimization model under uncertainty to solve the ECCER management problem in China's iron and steel industry. Three objectives: minimum energy intensity, maximum CO2 emission reduction, and minimum cost, are optimized simultaneously. This study simulates the perturbation of the uncertainty parameters within their fluctuation ranges via Latin Hypercube Sampling, adopts the mean objective function value mechanism to calculate the objective value, and obtains the optimized results using the second generation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Lastly, this study sets three types of preferences to generate final decision strategies via a Vague set-based approach. Results show: (1) The algorithm is reliable as per the verification of Hypervolume indicator and Spacing Metric; (2) The average values of energy intensity and CO2 emission reduction amount in optimal solutions are 524.00 kgce and 125.03 kg per ton steel respectively, which are 6.3% and 7.6% lower than the deterministic optimal ones; (3) The decision strategies encourage the wider application of large-sized process equipment, identify 8-9 advanced technology and eight reutilization approaches as key measures, but find the use of renewable energy will still be in low level. This study aims to solve the industrial ECCER optimization problem under uncertainty, and put forward policy suggestions in sustainable manufacturing in this industry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Balancing sustainability and disruption of supply chains requires organizational ambidexterity. Sustainable supply chains prioritize efficiency and economies of scale and may not have sufficient redundancy to withstand disruptive events. There is a developing body of literature that attempts to reconcile these two aspects. This study gives a data-driven literature review of sustainable supply chain management trends toward ambidexterity and disruption. The critical review reveals temporal trends and geographic distribution of literature. A hybrid of data-driven analysis approach based on content and bibliometric analyses, fuzzy Delphi method, entropy weight method, and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used on 273 keywords and 22 indicators obtained based on the experts’ evaluation. The most important indicators are identified as supply chain agility, supply chain coordination, supply chain finance, supply chain flexibility, supply chain resilience, and sustainability. The regions show different tendencies compared with others. Asia and Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Africa are the regions needs improvement, while Europe and North America show distinct apprehensions on supply chain network design. The main contribution of this review is the identification of the knowledge frontier, which then leads to a discussion of prospects for future studies and practical industry implementation. © 2020},

In addition, based on the model that maps decision parameters to objective performance through neural network, a new robustness evaluation metric is created as the fitness value of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (for improving the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEAII)) to elaborate the relationship between robustness and fluctuation. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified with HCN production process application by comparing with genetic algorithm (GA) and weighted single-objective robust optimization. © 2018},

It is increasingly important to study the factors affecting China's CO2 emissions. Many researches had extensively researched the driving forces of CO2 emissions of China. However, majority of the researches adopt a conventional linear method based on time-series or cross-section data for researching the CO2 emissions as well as nearly neglect nonlinear relationships. To surmount the limitations of extant investigations, this research adopts a data-driven nonparametric additive regression approach to examine primary influencing factors of China's CO2 emissions. The results manifest that the nonlinear influence of economy on CO2 emissions is same as the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The household consumption level embodies the inverted “U-type” pattern. The industrialization also embodies the overturned “U-type” relationship. Aggregate retail sales of consumer goods present a positive “U-type” effect upon CO2 emissions. Similarly, the urbanization signifies a positive “U-type” nexus upon CO2 emissions. Energy intensity indicates a positive “U-type” nexus. The paper ought to exert more attention to the dynamic effects of the driving forces above in order to abate the CO2 emissions of China. This study will also propose corresponding policies and recommendations according to the dynamic effects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

De-spite this growing interest in AFS, comprehensive analyses of the scholarly literature are hard to find. Therefore, the present systematic review delineated the contours of this growing research strand and analyzed how it relates to sustainability. A search performed on the Web of Science in January 2020 yielded 1389 documents, and 1289 were selected and underwent bibliometric and topical analyses. The topical analysis was informed by the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) approach of FAO and structured along four dimensions viz. environment, economy, society and culture, and policy and governance. The review shows an increasing interest in AFS with an exponential increase in publications number. However, the study field is north-biased and dominated by researchers and organizations from developed countries. Moreover, the analysis suggests that while environmental aspects are sufficiently addressed, social, economic, and political ones are generally overlooked. The paper ends by providing directions for future research and listing some topics to be integrated into a comprehensive, multidisciplinary agenda addressing the multifaceted (un)sustainability of AFS. It makes the case for adopting a holistic, 4‐P (planet, people, profit, policy) approach in agri‐food system studies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The demand for natural gas is expected to continuously increase due to its significant role in the transition towards a low-carbon energy structure. Based on the nonhomogeneous grey model, a new method for estimating natural gas production and consumption is developed, namely, the conformable fractional nonhomogeneous grey Bernoulli model (denoted as CFNHGBM(1,1,k) for short). In the new method, the Bernoulli equation is first introduced into the existing differential equation. The traditional accumulation is then replaced with conformable fractional accumulation. Finally, the moth flame optimization (MFO) algorithm is applied to determine the structural parameters for the novel model. Moreover, when taking different values, the novel model will be changed into the existing grey serial models. Based on natural gas production and consumption from 2008 to 2018, we use the proposed model to predict future data from 2019 to 2021 in North America, and the forecasts show that the novel model performs better than other competitors. Furthermore, natural gas production and consumption maintain steady increasing trends with average annual growth rates of 3.29% and 2.02%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Important emission-reduction measures mainly include carbon trading and low-carbon cost subsidies. Comprehensive consideration of these two policies is a research hotspot in the field of low-carbon technology investment. Based on this background, this paper considers the impact of consumer low-carbon preferences on market demand and the impact of uncertainty in carbon emission-reduction behaviour. We construct a stochastic differential game model with upstream and downstream enterprises based on cost-sharing coordination under a cost subsidy. From a dynamic perspective, this paper researches the optimal equilibrium strategy and evolution characteristics of the joint emission-reduction mechanism in a supply chain. This paper discusses the sensitivity of the parameters and uses numerical simulation to verify the impact of each parameter on the emission-reduction decision-making activities of stakeholders after introducing the cost subsidy. The results show that a cost subsidy policy can promote carbon emission-reduction investment and supply chain profit. Thus, it is important to strengthen technical cooperation and exchange among enterprises.  © 2021 Shan Yu and Qiang Hou.},

	abstract = {Closed loop supply chain network design (CL-SCND) is a critical economic and environmental activity. The closing of the loop to handle return, uncertainty in business environment, various supply chain risks, impact network design processes and performance of the firm in the long term. Thus, it is important to design robust and reliable supply chain structures and obtain network configurations which can always outperform the other configurations under the worst cases of risks and uncertainty. A generic closed-loop supply chain network based on mixed integer programming formulation is proposed with direct shipping to the customer from manufacturing plants as well as shipping through distribution centers under supply risks, transportation risk and uncertain demand using a robust optimization (RO) approach. A large number of numerical tests are carried out to test the performance of the model by considering a total of four levels of uncertainty for four different network structures types. The results of the tests confirm that the risk and uncertainty based integrated supply chain network models are more efficient (cost effective) than the other set of network configurations which treats the supply chain risks and uncertainty post-ante. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, the case of an Indian e-commerce firm which wants to redesign its supply chain structure is presented. The results of case study show that the topology obtained from integrated treatment of risk and uncertainty called as RORU model, outperform other supply chain networks on various network performance indicators such as supply chain costs, the number of facilities open or close and the amount of products flowing through supply chain echelon. Thus, RO based mathematical modeling to address risks and its applicability for SCND for close loop supply chain is proposed, demonstrated and applied in practical cases. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

The alliance can not only effectively integrate enterprise resources, but also efficiently adapt to the change of market environment. However, the various uncertainties in the alliance become a major obstacle to PGSU development. To ensure the healthy development of the alliance, risk evaluation has become a crucial step. This paper aims to identify risk factors through questionnaire survey and literature review and calculate the overall risk levels of PGSU VEs with an integrated approach with fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP). Results of factors identification consisted of market, social politics and environmental, capacity, cooperation and coordination, alliance formation and risk commitment and profit distribution risk categories. Overall risk levels of three VEs were calculated and ranked with proposed approach whose feasibility and consistency were verified through a comparative analysis with Best Worst Method (BWM) and Stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA). Moreover, considering existing risks, some suggestions were put forward for future development of clean PGSU VE.

	abstract = {Automated calibration of complex deterministic water quality models with a large number of biogeochemical parameters can reduce time-consuming iterative simulations involving empirical judgements of model fit. We undertook autocalibration of the one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological lake model DYRESM-CAEDYM, using a Monte Carlo sampling (MCS) method, in order to test the applicability of this procedure for shallow, polymictic Lake Rotorua (New Zealand). The calibration procedure involved independently minimizing the root-mean-square error (RMSE), maximizing the Pearson correlation coefficient (<i>r</i>) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficient coefficient (<i>Nr</i>) for comparisons of model state variables against measured data. An assigned number of parameter permutations was used for 10ĝ€000 simulation iterations. The "optimal" temperature calibration produced a RMSE of 0.54ĝ€°C, <i>Nr</i> value of 0.99, and <i>r</i> value of 0.98 through the whole water column based on comparisons with 540 observed water temperatures collected between 13 July 2007 and 13 January 2009. The modeled bottom dissolved oxygen concentration (20.5ĝ€m below surface) was compared with 467 available observations. The calculated RMSE of the simulations compared with the measurements was 1.78ĝ€mgĝ€Lĝ'1, the <i>Nr</i> value was 0.75, and the <i>r</i> value was 0.87. The autocalibrated model was further tested for an independent data set by simulating bottom-water hypoxia events from 15 January 2009 to 8 June 2011 (875 days). This verification produced an accurate simulation of five hypoxic events corresponding to DOĝ€ &lt; ĝ€2ĝ€mgĝ€Lĝ'1 during summer of 2009-2011. The RMSE was 2.07ĝ€mgĝ€Lĝ'1, <i>Nr</i> value 0.62, and <i>r</i> value of 0.81, based on the available data set of 738 days. The autocalibration software of DYRESM-CAEDYM developed here is substantially less time-consuming and more efficient in parameter optimization than traditional manual calibration which has been the standard tool practiced for similar complex water quality models. © Author(s) 2018.},

	abstract = {Supply chains (SCs) are dynamic networks subject to uncertainties and risks that may occur anywhere, anytime, and whose consequences affect the entities that comprise such SC, possibly affecting others. In fact, there are several examples wherein the occurrence of certain events resulted in considerable costs. Thus, it is important to ensure that SCs can apply preemptive measures, rather than just react to disruptions that may occur. Simulation tools may play an important role in achieving this, as these tools may be used to test alternative scenarios, as well as to quantify the impact of risks. To fully exploit this possibility, simulation tools should be used as data integration tools, so that the aforementioned analysis can be conducted using data from several relevant sources, thereby improving the quality of such analysis. In this regard, this paper proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of simulation methods that deal with risks in SCs, with particular emphasis on the type of data integration employed by such works. The obtained results show that researchers tend to simplify the problem at hand, without modeling their entire complexity, and failing to properly integrate data from the involved processes. The analyzed works’ compliance with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) revealed similar conclusions, as it was found that studies tend to disregard some of the main features of simulation in I4.0. In light of the obtained findings, literature gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

The literature has presented a summary of the evolution of sustainable supply chain management across attributes. Prior studies have evaluated different parts of the supply chain as independent entities. An integrated systematic assessment is absent in the extant literature and makes it necessary to identify potential opportunities for research direction. A hybrid of data-driven analysis, the fuzzy Delphi method, the entropy weight method and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is adopted to address uncertainty and complexity. This study contributes to locating the boundary of fundamental knowledge to advance future research and support practical execution. Valuable direction is provided by reviewing the existing literature to identify the critical indicators that need further examination. The results show that big data, closed-loop supply chains, industry 4.0, policy, remanufacturing, and supply chain network design are the most important indicators of future trends and disputes.

	abstract = {Bioenergy is widely considered a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, large-scale applications of biomass-based energy products are limited due to challenges related to feedstock variability, conversion economics, and supply chain reliability. Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging concept, has been applied to bioenergy systems in recent decades to address those challenges. This paper reviewed 164 articles published between 2005 and 2019 that applied different AI techniques to bioenergy systems. This review focuses on identifying the unique capabilities of various AI techniques in addressing bioenergy-related research challenges and improving the performance of bioenergy systems. Specifically, we characterized AI studies by their input variables, output variables, AI techniques, dataset size, and performance. We examined AI applications throughout the life cycle of bioenergy systems. We identified four areas in which AI has been mostly applied, including (1) the prediction of biomass properties, (2) the prediction of process performance of biomass conversion, including different conversion pathways and technologies, (3) the prediction of biofuel properties and the performance of bioenergy end-use systems, and (4) supply chain modeling and optimization. Based on the review, AI is particularly useful in generating data that are hard to be measured directly, improving traditional models of biomass conversion and biofuel end-uses, and overcoming the challenges of traditional computing techniques for bioenergy supply chain design and optimization. For future research, efforts are needed to develop standardized and practical procedures for selecting AI techniques and determining training data samples, to enhance data collection, documentation, and sharing across bioenergy-related areas, and to explore the potential of AI in supporting the sustainable development of bioenergy systems from holistic perspectives. © 2021 The Authors.

This mode of transport has been beneficial through its efficiency in the mobility of a large quantities of merchandise. In this context, inland waterway ports are one of the mainstays of the maritime transportation network. The aim of this paper is (1) to model and assess the interdependency between inland port infrastructure and its surrounding supply chain and (2) to show how the disturbance in one will have a ripple effect and trigger cascading failures in the entire network. To comprehend this interconnectedness, we outline three thorough interdependency types: geographic, service provision, and access for repair. After these interdependency types are validated, the factors related to port disruption and its supply chain performance are identified, and the Bayesian network is applied to visualize the interdependency among these factors. The quantification of interdependency is examined, and the results are profoundly analyzed through different advanced techniques such as belief propagation and sensitivity analysis. The general interpretation of these analyses entails that environmental factors and supplier responsiveness are imperative to port disruption and supply chain performance, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In order to provide a reference for China's biomass power planning, this paper builds a power sector-planning model using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP). The results show that in the base scenario, the installed capacity of agricultural and forestry residues, municipal solid waste and biogas will increase to 22350 MW, 21150 MW, and 4900 MW, respectively by 2030. From the point of view of total volume, biomass supply is not a constraining factor for biomass power source. However, there are some social and economic factors that impede the development of the biomass power industry, some of which may not be addressed in the short term. Therefore, the development of the biomass power industry in China is a long-term process. Some policy suggestions were proposed, including reasonable planning and more subsidies for biomass supply value chain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In this context, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), countries which have the highest increase in electricity production in the period of 2000-2018, are included in the scope of this study. Annual data of these variables in the period of 1991-2018 are used and three different models are created by using Vector Auto Regression (VAR) methodology. The findings state that electricity production in BRICS countries has a positive effect on both industrial production and sustainable economic growth. Hence, electricity production needs to be increased for them. For this purpose, it is important to encourage investors with tax advantages, location orientation and financing. Moreover, BRICS countries should give importance to renewable energy investments in order to increase electricity production.

	abstract = {Data Mining (DM) is a fundamental component of the Data Science process. Over recent years a huge library of DM algorithms has been developed to tackle a variety of problems in fields such as medical imaging and traffic analysis. Many DM techniques are far more flexible than more classical numerial simulation or statistical modelling approaches. These could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as artificial neural networks, clustering, case-based reasoning or Bayesian networks have been applied in environmental modelling, while other methods, like support vector machines among others, have yet to be taken up on a wide scale. There is greater scope for many lesser known techniques to be applied in environmental research, with the potential to contribute to addressing some of the current open environmental challenges. However, selecting the best DM technique for a given environmental problem is not a simple decision, and there is a lack of guidelines and criteria that helps the data scientist and environmental scientists to ensure effective knowledge extraction from data. This paper provides a broad introduction to the use of DM in Data Science processes for environmental researchers. Data Science contains three main steps (pre-processing, data mining and post-processing). This paper provides a conceptualization of Environmental Systems and a conceptualization of DM methods, which are in the core step of the Data Science process. These two elements define a conceptual framework that is on the basis of a new methodology proposed for relating the characteristics of a given environmental problem with a family of Data Mining methods. The paper provides a general overview and guidelines of DM techniques to a non-expert user, who can decide with this support which is the more suitable technique to solve their problem at hand. The decision is related to the bidimensional relationship between the type of environmental system and the type of DM method. An illustrative two way table containing references for each pair Environmental System-Data Mining method is presented and discussed. Some examples of how the proposed methodology is used to support DM method selection are also presented, and challenges and future trends are identified. © 2018},

	abstract = {Uncertainty propagation of large-scale discrete supply chains can be prohibitive when numerous events occur during the simulated period and when discrete-event simulations (DES) are costly. We present a time-bucket method to approximate and accelerate the DES of supply chains. Its stochastic version, which we call the L(logistic)-leap method, can be viewed as an extension of the leap methods (e.g., τ-leap [36]and D-leap [6] developed in the chemical engineering community for the acceleration of stochastic DES of chemical reactions). The L-leap method instantaneously updates the system state vector at discrete time points, and the production rates and policies of a supply chain are assumed to be stationary during each time bucket. We propose using the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method to efficiently propagate the uncertainties in a supply chain network, where the levels are naturally defined by the sizes of the time buckets of the simulations. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our methods using four numerical examples derived from a real-world manufacturing material flow application. In these examples, our multilevel L-leap approach can be faster than the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method by one or two orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. © 2020},

	abstract = {This work presents an optimization model for the strategic planning to satisfy the national demands of natural gas considering unconventional extraction such as shale gas and offshore extraction and conventional ways to produce associated and non-associated natural gas using enhanced gas recovery systems, as well as importation. The model incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain trade-offs between economic, environmental and health issues. A case study from Mexico is presented to show the applicability of the proposed approach to satisfy the increasing national demand of natural gas through different extraction ways. Furthermore, in the presented study, economic, environmental and health factors were evaluated to select the best option. The economic factors consider costs associated with the production and treatment of natural gas, the used fresh water and the costs that involve the transportation of natural gas from its point of extraction to final markets. Regarding to the environmental impact, the fresh water consumption and CO2 emissions are considered. The occupational health of the involved processes in the production of natural gas is also evaluated, this because workers are continuously exposed to hazardous substances that can cause long-term damage. Results show that it is possible to decrease imports to satisfy the national demands for natural gas only with their own resources, and taking care for the economic, environmental and health issues. By maximizing PROFIT, 65.9% is satisfied through the production of shale gas and the rest is satisfied by the other extraction processes without using importation; this scenario represents a PROFIT of 1.58 × 1010 $/y, 22.774 total MMmetric ton CO2e/y and 36.576 MMm3/y for consumed fresh water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective of this study is to afford a comprehensive review of the studies which aim to develop models and methods in helping enterprises to assess and select the right green suppliers. To achieve this goal, a total of 193 journal articles extracted from the Scopus database over the period of 2009 to 2020 were chosen and reviewed. These publications were classified into ten categories based on their adopted GSES models and analyzed concerning the evaluation criteria, criteria weighting methods, and performance evaluation methods. Moreover, a bibliometric analysis was conducted according to the frequency of supplier selection methods, citation number, publication year, journal, country, and application area. This study supports practitioners, managers, and researchers in effectively recognizing and applying the GSES models to enhance organizational competitiveness and provides an insight into its state of the art. © 2020 Li-Jun Zhang et al.},

Due to its impact on organization's competitive power, researchers have proposed models to measure social performance in supply chains. However, most of these researches reveal shortcomings once encountering the cases with a huge number of criteria due to their complex computations. In order to fill this gap, this study proposes a new soft computing multi-criteria interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy distance to ideal solution approach based on interval-valued Pythagorean closeness which performs outstandingly in cases with a high fluctuation in the number of criteria. A new mechanism is defined to distinguish the weak performing social factors through supply chains by classifying them into four categorize based on their performance and distance to the best performing factors. This approach is unique in the sense that it both covers a remarkable amount of uncertainty and eases the computational processes of the previous multi-criteria decision making approaches by modifying the steps to select the most ideal solution. The feasibility and applicability of this approach have been validated by applications to a numerical case and comparative analysis. © 2021},

The relevance of the critical quality attributes is related to the reduction of the workload in the subsequent downstream operations and the establishment of a robust process with a characteristic and reproducible product quality fingerprint.

	abstract = {Energy models are valuable tools that are commonly employed for the optimal design of distributed energy systems (DES). However, the model-based design process of DES can be affected by uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal design decisions and is introduced by aspects like the stochastic nature of renewables or the unknown future global energy and economy outlook. A critical first step of any effort to examine and incorporate uncertainty in the design process of DES includes the performance of a thorough uncertainty characterisation (UC). The UC task comprises the identification of the sources of uncertainty in the model's parameters and the assignment of a mathematical description to their uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to identify and categorise the most important uncertain parameters in typical DES design models and review the approaches used in the literature to represent their uncertainty. The uncertain aspects investigated pertain to the availability of renewable energy (wind and solar), the economic and environmental dimensions of energy carriers in a DES, the costs and technical characteristics of the technologies composing a DES, and, finally, the uncertain energy demands that a DES must satisfy. The analysis reveals the diversity and the varying complexity levels of the approaches used to characterise each parameter's uncertainty, as well as the specific parameters on which studies in the literature have mostly focused. Additionally, this review can serve to assist modellers who wish to introduce uncertainty considerations in their DES design model with the selection of appropriate UC approaches. Finally, in discussing the results of this review, directions for more effective UC in DES design are discussed, as well as suggestions for the integration of uncertainty in the design process of DES. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The model aims to determine sourcing and network design decisions that minimise the expected total cost while ensuring that the minimum customer service level is achieved. The proposed model incorporates several resilience strategies including multiple sourcing, multiple transport routes, considering backup suppliers, adding extra production capacities, as well as lateral transshipment and direct shipment. A multi-cut L-shaped solution approach is developed to solve the proposed model. Data from a real case problem in the paint industry is utilised to test the model and solution approach. Important managerial insights are obtained from the case study. Our analyses focus on (1) exploring the relationship between supply chain cost and customer service level, (2) examining the impacts of different types of disruptions on the total cost, (3) evaluating the utility of resilience strategies, (4) investigating the benefits of the proposed solution approach to solve problems of different sizes and (5) benchmarking the performance of the proposed stochastic programming approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {With increasing attention on protecting the environment and social involvement, the concept of sustainable development has been widely mentioned in various industries. A new management mode, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), has come into being and has become a hot topic of discussion. As sustainable supplier selection is the most important issue in this mode, many multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods for sustainable supplier selection have been proposed, though sometimes it is more useful the sorting of suppliers into classes that show the performance of such suppliers. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of the sorting method, AHPSort II, under a fuzzy environment with interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and a new way of selecting representative points for inferring suppliers’ priorities that will improve the management of unclear class assignments by softening transitions between classes facilitating the sustainable supplier selection. A significant reduction of comparisons compared to the AHP method together a higher precision of inferred priorities is occurred. This novel IT2FS sorting MCDM makes decisions become more in line with reality because of a better management of uncertainty and more accurate priorities. Finally, an application of the previous method to the selection of a sustainable material supplier is provided to show how the proposed method worked. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

The methodological procedures were based on a systematic literature review and statistical analysis of a sample of papers. The results indicated that modeling and simulation in supply chains can be better integrated. The models could be more sophisticated to capture the dynamics and behavior of these networks. The combination of optimization methods with agent-based simulation is an observed trend. Hybrid simulations involving normative models and empirical applications can be useful to represent the reality of supply chains, generating alternative solutions that improve supply chain performance.

	abstract = {Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is an engineering technique aimed at the detection of potential failures, their causes and consequences on the system/process under investigation. When used for the failure modes prioritization, FMEA is also referred to as Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). In traditional FMECA, risk priorities of failure modes are determined through the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a function of the three risk parameters Occurrence (O), Severity (S), and Detection (D). In the present paper, an alternative approach to the RPN is proposed for the criticality assessment of process/system failure modes. Particularly, the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method ELECTRE TRI is employed to assign failure modes to predefined and ordered risk classes, from the highest to the lowest risky one. Contrarily to the traditional RPN, the method allows the Decision Maker (DM) at taking into account the relative importance of risk parameters as well as his/her uncertainty in assigning each failure mode to a specific risk class. The ELECTRE TRI-based approach is implemented on the applicative case proposed by Kurt and Özilgen (2013) with reference to Turkish dairy manufacturing industries. A sensitivity analysis is finally performed in order to test the influence of the input parameters on the classification results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to explore what major themes and challenges have been discussed and the significant gaps where opportunities for further research can be found. Findings: In total, four categories of themes were identified, namely, human-centric, focal organization-centric, supply chain-centric and governance-centric. Challenges were classified into seven categories, namely, inadequate and asymmetric knowledge, difficulties of operationalization, shifting the values, subjectivity in evaluation, governance complexity, difficulties of small- and medium-sized enterprises and sustainability fade. Research limitations/implications: The focus of the article is on the social pillar of sustainable development in the context of supply chains. A more holistic systematic investigation of synergy of all the three pillars/bottom lines of sustainable development (economic, environmental and social) can be an opportunity for further research. Practical implications: Taking a more holistic view of the pattern of currently discussed themes and challenges may be beneficial in increasing the absorptive capacity of industrial and business practitioners, by accumulating and assimilating external knowledge, when they design and operationalize innovative strategies in developing sustainable supply chains. Originality/value: This article may increase awareness about the social responsibilities of supply chains actors and stakeholders in different scales. It may also guide managers, decision makers and practitioners to better understand the difficulties, obstacles or dilemmas that can hinder the sustainable development of supply chains. The results section presents a framework driven from the emerged themes, and the discussion section provides propositions for tackling the challenges and opportunities for further research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a decisional framework and a mathematical model for the sustainable design of biodiesel supply chain networks (BSCND). We consider a broad group of sustainable aims, i.e. standard economic goals (revenue and logistics costs of BSCND), environmental issues based on a biodiesel production life cycle assessment (LCA), and the social incidental aspects (e.g. crime control, political stability, and community attitude, among others). The framework begins with a simulation of the biodiesel production system, feeding later, with suitable input parameters and suitable solutions, and a macro-location model designed to establish the regional positioning of biofuel conversion plants. Optimal regions are used as initial feasible solution space for the proposed micro-location model. In this part of the framework, we introduce an adaptation of Extended Goal Programming to rank the best municipalities (definitive locations) emphasizing the social aspects under consideration. The framework application is set up in the following Colombian context: first generation biodiesel production from palm oil feedstock. Our computational results indicate that the Colombian city of Rionegro (in the Santader region) is the most sustainable location for a new biodiesel plant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current methodological approach for developing sustainable biofuel processes and supply chains is flawed. Life cycle principles are often retrospectively incorporated in the design phase resulting in incremental environmental improvement rather than selection of fuel pathways that minimize environmental impacts across the life cycle. Further, designing sustainable biofuel supply chains requires joint consideration of economic, environmental, and social factors that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, traditional life cycle assessment (LCA) ignores economic aspects and the role of ecological goods and services in supply chains, and hence is limited in its ability for guiding decision-making among alternatives-often resulting in sub-optimal solutions. Simultaneously incorporating economic and environment objectives in the design and optimization of emerging biofuel supply chains requires a radical new paradigm. This work discusses key research opportunities and challenges in the design of emerging biofuel supply chains and provides a high-level overview of the current "state of the art" in environmental sustainability assessment of biofuel production. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of over 20,000 biofuel research articles from 2000-to-present is performed to identify active topical areas of research in the biofuel literature, quantify the relative strength of connections between various biofuels research domains, and determine any potential research gaps. © 2015 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Catchment urbanization perturbs the water and sediment budgets of streams, degrades stream health and function, and causes a constellation of flow, water quality, and ecological symptoms collectively known as the urban stream syndrome. Low-impact development (LID) technologies address the hydrologic symptoms of the urban stream syndrome by mimicking natural flow paths and restoring a natural water balance. Over annual time scales, the volumes of stormwater that should be infiltrated and harvested can be estimated from a catchment-scale water-balance given local climate conditions and preurban land cover. For all but the wettest regions of the world, a much larger volume of stormwater runoff should be harvested than infiltrated to maintain stream hydrology in a preurban state. Efforts to prevent or reverse hydrologic symptoms associated with the urban stream syndrome will therefore require: (1) selecting the right mix of LID technologies that provide regionally tailored ratios of stormwater harvesting and infiltration; (2) integrating these LID technologies into next-generation drainage systems; (3) maximizing potential cobenefits including water supply augmentation, flood protection, improved water quality, and urban amenities; and (4) long-term hydrologic monitoring to evaluate the efficacy of LID interventions. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Life cycle costing (LCC) is the state-of-the-art method to economically evaluate long-term projects over their life spans. However, uncertainty in long-range planning raises concerns about LCC results. In Part I of this series, we developed a holistic framework of the different types of uncertainty in infrastructure LCCs. We also collected methods to address these uncertainties. The aim of Part II is to evaluate the suitability of methods to cope with uncertainty in LCC. Part I addressed two research gaps. It presented a systematic collection of uncertainties and methods in LCC and, furthermore, provided a holistic categorization of both. However, Part I also raised new issues. First, a combined analysis of sources and methods is still outstanding. Such an investigation would reveal the suitability of different methods to address a certain type of uncertainty. Second, what has not been assessed so far is what types of uncertainty are insufficiently addressed in LCC. This would be a feature to improve accuracy of LCC results within LCC, by suggesting options to better cope with uncertainty. To address these research gaps, we conducted a systematic literature review. Part II analyzed the suitability of methods to address uncertainties. The suitability depends on data availability, type of data (tangible, intangible, random, non-random), screened hotspots, and tested modeling specifications. We identified types of uncertainties and methods that have been insufficiently addressed. The methods include probabilistic modeling such as design of experiment or subset simulation and evolutionary algorithm and Bayesian modeling such as the Bayesian latent Markov decision process. Subsequently, we evaluated learning potential from other life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). This analysis revealed 28 possible applications that have not yet been used in LCC. Lastly, we developed best practices for LCC practitioners. This systematic review complements prior research on uncertainty in LCC for infrastructure, as laid out in Part I. Part II concludes that all relevant methods to address uncertainty are currently applied in LCC. Yet, the level of application is different. Moreover, not all methods are equally suited to address different categories of uncertainty. This review offers guidance on what to do for each source and type of uncertainty. It illustrates how methods can address both based on current practice in LCC, LCA, and LCSA. The findings of Part II encourage a dialog between practitioners of LCC, LCA, and LCSA to advance research and practice in uncertainty analysis. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {In recent times, because of climate change and other negative consequences of environmental impact of manufacturing activities, environmentally conscious manufacturing (ECM) programme has emerged as one of the most important aspects and a proactive approach for improving sustainable performance of products and processes in majority of the manufacturing organizations requiring a total approach capable of addressing multiple dimensions of environmental management. Several indicators and methods for ECM have already been proposed by different researchers and practitioners from all over the world during the last few decades. Hence, a review of those indicators and methods may be considered a prime necessity so that the manufacturing organizations may easily select the appropriate methods to improve and sustain their environmental performance. In this paper, the application potential of several indicators and methods for ECM has been classified and the methods have been critically appraised highlighting their merits and limitations. Thereafter, a comprehensive, integrated and holistic generic research framework is proposed with different analysis and modelling techniques. The inherent characteristic features and the selection norms of these techniques are mentioned. Four different research issues are also addressed in the conclusions section. This paper will help the manufacturing organizations to develop their environmental management system (EMS).},

Geographic information system is a technology for making better decisions about location. To solve location planning problem, in this paper, a new preference aggregation algorithm using complementary slackness condition and discriminant analysis is developed. Applying a voting system for solving sustainable location planning problem is new and cannot be found in literature. Using geographic information system and factor analysis, a multiple attribute decision making problem is developed. In this paper, multiple attribute decision making problems are solved by our proposed method for ranking a voting system and also the sustainable location is obtained. A case study demonstrates efficiency of proposed method. For this purpose, the proposed method is used to determine the most appropriate locations for constructing agro-industries in Markazi province. In our real application, ten main criteria using obtained variances and eigen values are recognized. Seven locations are selected and ranked. Results show that Komain is the best location for constructing agro-industry and Komijan is the worst location. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

An objective of this survey is in an attempt to narrow the gap between the education and research communities. In the system of a channel flow, there are generally inlets and outlets. The flow is confined by the surrounding walls, and the fluid flows are predominantly in one direction. The pressure drop is significant in comparison with the momentum changes. The streamwise heat conduction is much less than the transverse counterpart. When combustion takes place in the system, source or sink terms will appear in the energy equation or species equations. In external flows, the fluid generally moves over a solid object (or objects), and is unbounded away from the object. Considerable effort has been devoted to inverse problems. Much attention has been paid to numerical methods handling the moving interface between two phases.},

	abstract = {Advanced companies have to face new challenges in the modern world. Emerging countries, policy makers and industrial companies are all urged to take product life cycle into consideration. Therefore, companies have to identify the best life-cycle-oriented solution in order to compete in the global market. The literature has developed some life cycle methodologies, such as life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA). However, in most of the researches, these methodologies are used simply to evaluate costs and environmental impacts along the whole life cycle, and therefore most of the available researches are not able to guarantee reaching the optimal solution. The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by proposing an optimisation model for both product life-cycle costs and environmental impacts. The purpose is to evaluate all the possible alternatives, in order to return a set of optimal solutions. The model, based on NSGA-2, is tested and compared with other two models based on linear programming. Finally, the model is applied to a real case study. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed literature review of the recent applications of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP) group decision-making methodologies. Design/methodology/approach: Among more than 600 related papers published in the period 2005-2009, a total of 232 application articles published in highly reputed international academic journals were selected and referenced in this paper. Papers were categorized according to application areas, subject titles, publication date, country of origin, academic journals, and integrated methodologies, and are summarized herein by various tables and charts. Findings: The findings show that during the years 2005-2009, use of the AHP technique has continued to increase exponentially. Moreover, it is expected that ANP will gain more popularity in the future, as the benefits of ANP become better understood. Applications of AHP have been dominant in manufacturing, followed by the environmental management and agriculture field, power and energy industry, transportation industry, construction industry, and healthcare. Other remarkable application fields include education, logistics, e-business, IT, R&D, telecommunication industry, finance and banking, urban management, defense industry and military, government, marketing, tourism and leisure, archaeology, auditing, and the mining industry. Research limitations/implications: The study does not consider theoretical based AHP or ANP articles. Also the search excluded conference proceedings, masters' theses, and doctoral dissertations. Practical implications: It is hoped that this study will guide practitioners in future work towards advancement of these techniques and will help the managers to select better decisions by making use of these methodologies. Originality/value: The paper presents a comprehensive literature review of recent applications of AHP, and also ANP decision tools over the period 2005-2009. Furthermore, the paper covers fuzzy AHP and fuzzy ANP extensions that are becoming popular methods in some application areas of traditional AHP and ANP. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Urban energy system planning (UESP) is a topic of growing concern for cities in deregulated energy markets, which plan to decrease energy demand, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy sources. UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem's context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods in the context of UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and the rationales for selecting and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems. The final outcome is a synthesis of the data and insights obtained, which may help potential users identify appropriate decision analysis methods based on given problem characteristics. © 2017 Cajot, Mirakyan, Koch and Maréchal.},

	abstract = {Numerical plant models can predict the outcome of plant traits modifications resulting from genetic variations, on plant performance, by simulating physiological processes and their interaction with the environment. Optimization methods complement those models to design ideotypes, that is, ideal values of a set of plant traits, resulting in optimal adaptation for given combinations of environment and management, mainly through the maximization of performance criteria (e.g. yield and light interception). As use of simulation models gains momentum in plant breeding, numerical experiments must be carefully engineered to provide accurate and attainable results, rooting them in biological reality. Here, we propose a multi-objective optimization formulation that includes a metric of performance, returned by the numerical model, and a metric of feasibility, accounting for correlations between traits based on field observations. We applied this approach to two contrasting models: a process-based crop model of sunflower and a functional–structural plant model of apple trees. In both cases, the method successfully characterized key plant traits and identified a continuum of optimal solutions, ranging from the most feasible to the most efficient. The present study thus provides successful proof of concept for this enhanced modelling approach, which identified paths for desirable trait modification, including direction and intensity. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Old industrial bases in Northeastern China have been experiencing a series of problems such as energy scarcity, economic slack and environmental pollution due to lack of scientific planning of energy systems. Effective energy system management is desirable for avoiding occurrence of these problems in the following decades under the national policy of revitalizing these industrial bases. This task is challenged by system complexity, data unavailability, and inaccurate demand forecasting which can hardly be resolved in existing studies. For improving energy system management in Qiqihar City, a representative industrial base in Northeastern China, under these challenges, a large-scale and fine-resolution Bayesian interval robust energy system optimization (BIRESO) approach is developed in this study. In detail, the structure, characteristics, problems and complexities of the energy system in this city are identified and analyzed. Based on these efforts, a series of optimized energy system management schemes are generated through construction of a BIRESO model and development of a solution algorithm. The obtained solutions can be ensured to remain robust when input data changes through controlling the degree of solution conservatism in accordance with probabilistic bounds on constraint violation. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation method was employed for effectively achieving dynamic forecast of energy demands. The tradeoff among energy security, economic development and environmental conservation under multiple uncertainties is revealed, and the optimal balance among them is identified. A scenario analysis approach is used to quantify the effects of economic growth on energy system schemes based on several developed scenarios. Results show that the BIRESO approach is capable of providing scientific support for energy supply planning, renewable energy development, technological advancement, facility expansion, energy allocation, pollution control, economic impacts assessment, and other energy related activities in Qiqihar City. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The role of the reservoir has become prominent in recent years due to increased demand for water, intensified pressure on limited water resources, more frequent extreme weather, and heightened degree of climate change. The management of multiple and multi-purpose reservoir systems is complex as it involves the issues of dimensionalities, nonlinearities and conflicts between different objectives. Optimization and simulation models have been used as a tool for providing quantitative information regarding optimal reservoir operation. This research demonstrates the use of optimization techniques to improve water allocation for multiple and multi-purpose reservoir systems. The optimal reservoir releases were determined by linear programing using IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio software. The objective function was developed to minimize water deficit in dry years under the constraints of reservoir storage, reservoir continuity, and water balance at each node of the river network. Two modeling approaches including time horizon and non-time horizon were applied to a case study of the Lower Chao Phraya River basin which is characterized by two reservoirs and a number of control structures along the channels. When compared to non- time horizon, the time horizon gave higher accuracy of the results. This suggested that using time horizon framework could provide beneficial support for better reservoir management and operational efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The use of AI for operations management, with its ability to evolve solutions, handle uncertainty and perform optimisation continues to be a major field of research. The growing body of publications over the last two decades means that it can be difficult to keep track of what has been done previously, what has worked, and what really needs to be addressed. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present a survey of the use of AI in operations management aimed at presenting the key research themes, trends and directions of research. Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds upon our previous survey of this field which was carried out for the ten-year period 1995-2004. Like the previous survey, it uses Elsevier's Science Direct database as a source. The framework and methodology adopted for the survey is kept as similar as possible to enable continuity and comparison of trends. Thus, the application categories adopted are: design; scheduling; process planning and control; and quality, maintenance and fault diagnosis. Research on utilising neural networks, case-based reasoning (CBR), fuzzy logic (FL), knowledge-Based systems (KBS), data mining, and hybrid AI in the four application areas are identified. Findings – The survey categorises over 1,400 papers, identifying the uses of AI in the four categories of operations management and concludes with an analysis of the trends, gaps and directions for future research. The findings include: the trends for design and scheduling show a dramatic increase in the use of genetic algorithms since 2003 that reflect recognition of their success in these areas; there is a significant decline in research on use of KBS, reflecting their transition into practice; there is an increasing trend in the use of FL in quality, maintenance and fault diagnosis; and there are surprising gaps in the use of CBR and hybrid methods in operations management that offer opportunities for future research. Originality/value – This is the largest and most comprehensive study to classify research on the use of AI in operations management to date. The survey and trends identified provide a useful reference point and directions for future research. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Fuels from biomass resources have emerged as a promising alternative to fossil fuel. Widely distributed source locations, varying feedstock, and specific regional conditions make it challenging to develop an optimization model that can be applied to any region to estimate the overall economics of producing these biofuels. The lack of a region specific, flexible optimization model makes it difficult for stakeholders like local policy makers, growers, and investors to make informed decisions about the economic viability and social and environmental impacts of biomass utilization. This novel contribution will illustrate an approach to develop a region specific optimization model which links various aspects of the biofuel supply chain such as feedstock source location, upstream and downstream logistics, as well as thermochemical and biochemical processing. This research shows how various individual optimization models can be combined, resulting in a complete, multivariable economic optimization model for a regional biomass network, paving a pathway for future work to develop an integrated framework for sustainability. The research demonstrated in this contribution illustrates the development of a model that can form the basis of a generalizable decision support tool that can guide investors and policy makers in making critical assessments on a local level in any particular region of interest. As a proof of concept, a portion of the described model will be validated using the Jackson Purchase region of Western Kentucky, USA, which is adjoining many coal fields and has various bio-based feedstocks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Three expansion approaches evaluated the impact on ethanol production costs of expanding an existing industry in one time step (one-step), or multiple time steps (multi-step), or constructing a newly emerging ethanol industry in Goiás (greenfield). In addition, the GHG emission intensity of the optimized ethanol supply chains are calculated. Under the three expansion approaches, the total ethanol production costs of sugarcane ethanol decrease from 894 US$/m3 ethanol in 2015 to 752, 715, and 710 US$/m3 ethanol in 2030 for the multi-step, one step and greenfield expansion respectively. For eucalyptus, ethanol production costs decrease from 635 US$/m3 in 2015 to 560 and 543 US$/m3 in 2030 for the multi-step and one-step approach. A general trend is the use of large scale industrial processing plants, especially towards 2030 due to increased biomass supply. We conclude that a system-wide optimization as a marginal impact on overall production costs. Utilizing all the predefined sugarcane and eucalyptus supply regions up to 2030, the results showed that on average the GHG emission intensity of sugarcane cultivation and processing is -80 kg CO2/m3, while eucalyptus GHG emission intensity is 1290 kg CO2/m3. This is due to the high proportion of forest land that is expected to be converted to eucalyptus plantations. Future optimization studies may address further economic or GHG emission improvement potential by optimizing the GHG emission intensity or perform a multi-objective optimization procedure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Due to the intermittent and uncontrollable nature of renewable energy resources, the performance of nZEB (net zero energy buildings) may suffer a great degree of uncertainties. In this study, a GA (genetic algorithm) optimization approach is employed to search optimal sizes of four design options for a net zero energy building. Then, sensitivity analysis is conducted on an optimized system (photovoltaic/wind turbine/bio-diesel generator) to investigate the impacts of the design input variations on the building performance (i.e. operation cost, CO2 emission, impact on grid). The results show that, with 20% variations in the four variables, the maximum change of the combined objective is 26.2%. In addition, wind velocity is the key factor concerning mismatch ratio, the cost and CDE (CO2 emissions), while the building loads should be considered with high priority concerning the comprehensive performance (combined objective) of the building. The performance of the energy system, integrating photovoltaic and bio-diesel generator, is not the best. But, compared with the other three design options, the variations of operation variables have least effects on its performance (i.e. most robust performance). The results also provide the quantitative assessment on the impact of active energy generation systems on enhancing the performance robustness of net zero energy buildings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study systematically summarizes previous research efforts on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) applied to energy and environment in the past four decades, including concepts and methodologies on DEA environmental assessment. Industrial developments are very important for all nations in terms of their economic prosperities. A problem is that the development produces various pollutions on air, water and other types of contaminations, all of which are usually associated with our health problems and climate changes. Thus, it is necessary for us to consider how to make a balance between economic success and pollution mitigation to maintain a high level of social sustainability in the world. It is widely considered that DEA is one of the methodologies to examine the level of sustainability. This study examines a recent research trend on DEA applications from 1980s to 2010s. Nowadays, many researchers have paid serious attention on how to combat various difficulties in the areas of energy and environment. As a result, the number of articles on DEA applications on energy and environment has dramatically increased, particularly after 2000s. However, it is true that DEA has strengths and drawbacks in the applications. Therefore, it is very important for us to carefully use DEA for guiding large policy issues and business strategies such as the global warming and climate change. An underlying premise of this study is that technology innovation in engineering and natural science may solve various problems by linking it with political and managerial efforts. The use of DEA provides a methodological linkage among them, so enhancing the practicality in mitigating problems due to climate change and environmental pollutions. This literature study, along with a summary on conceptual and methodological developments, provides us with guidelines for our future research works on DEA on energy and environment issues. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Recently, the use of advanced computational algorithms has entered coral reef science as new powerful tools that help solve complex coral reef related questions, which were unsolvable just a decade earlier. Some of these advanced algorithms consist of Computational Intelligence (CI) approaches, a branch of Artificial Intelligence that uses intelligent systems to address complex real-world problems yielding more robust, tractable and simpler solutions than those obtained by conventional mathematical techniques. This paper describes the most commonly used CI techniques related to coral reefs and the main improvements obtained with these methods over classical algorithms in this field. Some recommendations are given for the application of CI techniques to complex coral reef related problems, and vice-versa, for the application of novel coral reef dynamics concepts to improve the Coral Reef Optimization (CRO) algorithm, an optimization method inspired by coral reef dynamics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In most hydrologic modeling studies, the hypothesis is made that an improvement in the modeled soil moisture leads to an improvement in the modeled surface energy balance. The objective of this paper is to assess whether this hypothesis is true. The study was performed over the winter wheat fields in the AgriSAR 2006 domain. Remotely sensed soil moisture values and latent heat fluxes were used, in combination with in situ observations. First, the land cover and saturated subsurface flow parameters were estimated using the in situ observations. A spatially distributed model simulation was then performed, for which the Brooks–Corey parameters were derived from a soil texture map, and of which the results were validated using the remote sensing data. The remotely sensed soil moisture values were then used to optimize the Brooks–Corey parameters. As expected, a better performance with respect to the soil moisture estimation was obtained. However, this did not improve the latent heat flux estimates. This can be explained by the consumption of water from the deeper soil layers by the vegetation. The overall conclusion is that, under conditions where evapotranspiration is limited by energy and not by the soil moisture content, surface soil moisture values alone are not sufficient for the optimization of hydrologic model results. More data sets are needed for this purpose. © 2011, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Regret is defined as the deviation of objective value from the perfect information solution, and serves as an important evaluation metric for decision-making under uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel framework that effectively incorporates the minimax regret criterion into two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO). In addition to the conventional robustness criterion, this ARO framework also simultaneously optimizes the worst-case regret to push the performance of the resulting solution towards the utopia one under perfect information. By using a data-driven uncertainty set, we formulate a multiobjective ARO problem that generates a set of Pareto-optimal solutions to reveal the systematic trade-offs between the conventional robustness and minimax regret criteria. The resulting multi-level mixed-integer programming problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf optimization solvers, so we further propose tailored column-and-constraint generation algorithms to address the computational challenge. Two applications on process network planning and batch process scheduling are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed solution algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Achieving sustainable energy planning and development involves complex decision-making processes. The energy planning decision-making (EPDM) field relies on a plethora of decision analysis methods that offered many solutions to process a variety of energy management and strategic decision-making problems. However, current EPDM solutions are unable to overcome the increasing complexity of strategic energy planning situations involving a large number of stakeholders in uncertain, dynamic, and distributed environments. This raises significant new challenges for researchers in both decision sciences and renewable and sustainable energy planning. On the basis of a representative assortment of peer-reviewed related literature selected by querying multiple electronic databases and indexed in Scopus and Web of Science databases domain journals over the last 12 years, this paper exhaustively highlights and discusses limitations of existing strategic EPDM solutions. The analysis is based on a classification specially developed by holistically harmonizing important domain concepts to categorize the considered representative sample of the field of interest. Additionally, this paper integrates results and conclusions from some recent and most cited literature reviews to (i) formulate essential evidence as well as practical and conclusive literature's support– alongside with the formulated representative sample –to this paper's subsequent insights and statements, and (ii) guarantee that no relevant articles have been excluded. A total of 78 related works is gathered and analyzed to provide a general view and discussion on major complexities found in classical/traditional strategic EPDM solutions and challenges for next-generation EPDM solutions. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the two solutions and a set of “quality indexes” of a next-generation EPDM solution were identified and some proposals were made to improve future applicative research. As an original result coming from the “quality indexes” identified through the review process, an intelligent expert-based framework for next-generation EPDM solutions is developed for enhanced renewable and sustainable energy planning. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In order to assess the aspect of sustainability in agricultural production, different impact assessment tools could be implemented. Although LCA gives the potential to develop alternative scenarios in order to achieve the optimal environmental performance, in the context of sustainability, at the same time subjective measures are developed which are difficult to quantify. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is the key to solve the current weakness, since it takes into account multiple criteria in a wide assortment of aspects and thus it could integrate sustainability elements. The purpose of this study is to outline the integration of LCA and MCA methodologies and develop a complete literature review regarding the sustainability of the agricultural sector through the above mentioned methodological merge. In this review we analyze scientific papers integrating LCA and different multi-criteria methodologies in agriculture. Through this analysis, we determine the connection between the methodologies through a variety of aspects regarding (a) the number and nature of multi-criteria methods integrated with LCA, (b) the way of integration between the methods in a technical perspective and (c) the benefits developed through the integration as well as the final conclusions which could only be elicited through this complex process. Studies which implemented LCA and MCA simultaneously illustrated positive economic and environmental results, since LCA focused on environmental sustainability and the multi-criteria modeling dealt with the subjective measures of LCA. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

The book Multisensor Data Fusion and Machine Learning for Environmental Remote Sensing offers complete understanding of the basic scientific principles needed to perform image processing, gap filling, data merging, data fusion, machine learning, and feature extraction. Written by two experts in remote sensing, the book presents the required basic concepts, tools, algorithms, platforms, and technology hubs toward advanced integration. By merging and fusing data sets collected from different satellite sensors with common features, we are enabled to utilize the strength of each satellite sensor to the maximum extent. The inclusion of machine learning or data mining techniques to aid in feature extraction after gap filling, data merging and/or data fusion further empowers earth observation, leading to confirm the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Contemporary applications discussed in this book make all essential knowledge seamlessly integrated by an interdisciplinary manner. These case-based engineering practices uniquely illustrate how to improve such an emerging field of importance to cope with the most challenging real-world environmental monitoring issues. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Global warming and climate change are now a very serious issue around the world. The climate change problem, due to global warming, implies an increase in average global temperature regarding air, sea and land. Natural events and economic activities, including industrial developments and business activities, contribute to the increase in average global temperature. Such a climate change is primarily caused by an increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. In addition, we are now facing various environmental difficulties, such as how to handle nuclear and industrial wastes, all of which are byproducts of our economic and industrial developments. To combat the environmental issues, this book discusses the importance of both economic success and environmental protection for sustainability enhancement. The underlying philosophy of this book is that we need to develop eco-technology innovation and managerial challenges to support a progress for reducing an amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In challenging toward such a research direction, this book proposes a new use of "data envelopment analysis (DEA)," as a holistic approach, to assess various aspects concerning sustainability development. In the sense, the new methodology proposed in this book is referred to as "DEA environmental assessment." © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A thorough description of a built environment's life cycle (brief; design; raw material extraction, transport and processing; construction materials production and distribution; construction; use, repair and maintenance; demolition and disposal, reuse, or recycling analysis) is difficult to procure. A building and its environment comprise a complex system based on its technical, technological, economical, social, cultural, ecological and other aspects. All sub-systems influence the total efficiency performance. The interdependence between subsystems also plays a significant role. This monograph's research objective is the life cycle of a built environment along with its interested parties striving to attain their goals in the micro-, meso- and macro-environments that make an integral whole. Comprehensive research of this required development of new methods for the multiple criteria analysis of a project that would enable a user to assess its quantitative and qualitative aspects thoroughly. The diversity of the factors under assessment corresponds to various ways for presenting data needed for decision making. Various researches on the life cycle of a built environment and/or its composite parts at micro-, meso- and macro-levels are under global development. Such researches analyze energetic, technical, technological, economic, legal/regulatory, innovative and microclimatic aspects. However, they ignore the social, cultural, ethical, psychological, emotional, religious and ethnic aspects of a built environment's life cycle. It is notable that not one researcher from different countries analyzed the life cycle of a built environment and its stages in the way the authors of this investigation have considered them. Here, the authors also involve the stakeholders in the life cycle as well as the micro-, meso- and macro-environments that have particular impact on making an integral whole. This monograph contains detailed revisions of the research along with theoretical and practical tasks for analyzing the life cycle of a built environment and includes presentations of distinctive examples. The concept of a modern life cycle of a built environment as a model is discussed. The theoretical and practical analyses presented in this monograph verify that intelligent decision support systems allow different stakeholders to achieve improved work quality results and productivity. An organized creative team of interested groups can produce a life cycle of a built environment that considers qualitative societal aspects to a greater degree. Realistically, most of a built environment life cycle will have both positive and negative features. The mission is to arrive at an equilibrium of pros and cons to optimize the life cycle of a built environment by a system of qualitative and quantitative criteria. Integration of intelligent decision support systems in the life cycle of a built environment is undoubtedly one step in the right direction. Here, the knowledge relevant to the development of a built environment life cycle appears by its economic, legal, technological, technical, organizational, social, cultural, ethical, psychological, emotional, religious and environmental terms, as well as its managerial implications. References to the most modern sources of scientific literature worldwide are also included. The readers targeted for this monograph include researchers, MSc and PhD civil engineering students and parties involved in construction management and real estate development.

	abstract = {Climate feedbacks from soils can result from environmental change followed by response of plant and microbial communities, and/or associated changes in nutrient cycling. Explicit consideration of microbial life-history traits and functions may be necessary to predict climate feedbacks owing to changes in the physiology and community composition of microbes and their associated effect on carbon cycling. Here we developed the microbial enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model by incorporating microbial dormancy and the ability to track multiple isotopes of carbon. We tested two versions of MEND, that is, MEND with dormancy (MEND) and MEND without dormancy (MEND-wod), against long-term (270 days) carbon decomposition data from laboratory incubations of four soils with isotopically labeled substrates. MEND-wod adequately fitted multiple observations (total C-CO2 and 14C-CO2 respiration, and dissolved organic carbon), but at the cost of significantly underestimating the total microbial biomass. MEND improved estimates of microbial biomass by 20-71% over MEND-wod. We also quantified uncertainties in parameters and model simulations using the Critical Objective Function Index method, which is based on a global stochastic optimization algorithm, as well as model complexity and observational data availability. Together our model extrapolations of the incubation study show that long-term soil incubations with experimental data for multiple carbon pools are conducive to estimate both decomposition and microbial parameters. These efforts should provide essential support to future field- and global-scale simulations, and enable more confident predictions of feedbacks between environmental change and carbon cycling. © 2015 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

As multiple criteria decision-making is a specific perspective to deal with decision problems in energy-related environmental studies with the rapid changes and the increasing complexity of the energy issues, DA techniques have been extended to further methodological developments. This paper aims at illustrating the evolution of DA techniques involved in energy and environmental decision situations. Earlier surveys are extended and refined by classifying and comparing the DA techniques used in 115 energy and environmental studies. It was found that there is increasing importance placed on DA methods, and energy and environmental studies had increased substantially in last ten years.

	abstract = {Bioenergy parks are integrated energy systems developed based on material and energy synergies among bioenergy and auxiliary plants to increase efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. However, the resulting high interdependence between component units results to a vulnerable network upon capacity disruptions (i.e., plant inoperability). Inoperability of one or more plants within a bioenergy park results in a deviation from an initial network configuration because of failure propagation. The consequences of such disruptions depend upon which component units caused the failure. In this work, a probabilistic multi-disruption risk index is developed to measure the net output change of a bioenergy park based on exogenously-defined plant disruption scenarios, whose probabilities are estimated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This network index is an important measure of the system's robustness to an array of probabilistic perturbation scenarios. Such risk-based information can be used for developing risk management measures to reduce network vulnerability through increasing system redundancy and diversity. A bioenergy park case study is presented to demonstrate the computation of the multi-disruption risk index. © 2015 .},

	abstract = {In the current era of sustainable development, energy planning has become complex due to the involvement of multiple benchmarks like technical, social, economic and environmental. This in turn puts major constraints for decision makers to optimize energy alternatives independently and discretely especially in case of rural communities. In addition, topographical limitations concerning renewable energy systems which are mostly distributed in nature, the energy planning becomes more complicated. In such cases, decision analysis plays a vital role for designing such systems by considering various criteria and objectives even at disintegrated levels of electrification. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is a branch of operational research dealing with finding optimal results in complex scenarios including various indicators, conflicting objectives and criteria. This tool is becoming popular in the field of energy planning due to the flexibility it provides to the decision makers to take decisions while considering all the criteria and objectives simultaneously. This article develops an insight into various MCDM techniques, progress made by considering renewable energy applications over MCDM methods and future prospects in this area.

	abstract = {A major obstacle to sustainable biofuel production is the sheer complexity of the decisions facing producers and stakeholders. Integrated biorefining is a viable technology for converting a wide range of resources - biomass waste materials, dedicated energy crops, municipal solid waste, animal waste and forest products - into fuels and chemicals. But making the best choice among various available resources, process technologies and supply chain designs is no simple task, especially when sustainability is a criterion. Additional complexity arises because the relevant factors will be weighted differently by different constituencies. The risk of unintended consequences must also be considered: what can seem to be good decisions may prove unsustainable in the long term unless all potential implications can be assessed. To addresses these challenges an integrated approach including discrete event simulation is required due to the necessity to evaluate the effects of uncertainty over an extended time horizon. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the current formulation, a distributed strategy which is composed of different layers including strategic optimization, risk management, detailed mechanistic modeling, and operational level optimization is applied. In the strategic model, a multiobjective stochastic optimization approach is utilized to incorporate the tradeoffs between the cost and the financial risk. Then, Aspen Plus models are built to provide detailed simulation of biorefineries. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to optimize the operating condition. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, a hypothetical case study referring to a multiproduct lignocellulosic biorefinery is utilized. The numerical results reveal the efficacy of the proposed approach; it provides decision makers with a quantitative analysis to determine the optimum capacity plan and operating conditions of the biorefinery. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {The mechanistic integration of microbial behavior remains a major challenge in biogeochemical modeling of organic matter turnover in soil. We recently introduced dynamic feedbacks between specific microbial groups and their micro-environment in a biogeochemical model (Pagel et al., 2014). Here, the model was applied in a case study to simulate pesticide degradation coupled to carbon (C) turnover in the detritusphere. We aimed at unravelling the effects of litter-derived substrate supply on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microbial community and the resulting biogeochemical processes at the mm-scale in soil. We linked genetic information on abundances of bacteria, fungi and specific pesticide degraders to the biogeochemical dynamics of C and a generic model compound (MCPA, 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid) in soil by multiobjective calibration. We observed and simulated increased dissolved organic and microbial C as well as accelerated MCPA degradation in soil up to a 6 mm distance to litter. We found that, whereas transport and sorption processes act as extrinsic control on the encounter of microorganisms and substrates, microbial traits such as substrate preference or metabolic capabilities intrinsically determine turnover rates triggering feedback effects on physicochemical processes such as diffusion. A process analysis revealed that C cycling and pesticide degradation in the detritusphere were strongly controlled by fungal dynamics. Our study demonstrates that integrating mathematical modeling with experiments provides comprehensive insight into the microbial regulation of matter cycling in soil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The remarkable complexity of soil and its importance to a wide range of ecosystem services presents major challenges to the modeling of soil processes. Although major progress in soil models has occurred in the last decades, models of soil processes remain disjointed between disciplines or ecosystem services, with considerable uncertainty remaining in the quality of predictions and several challenges that remain yet to be addressed. First, there is a need to improve exchange of knowledge and experience among the different disciplines in soil science and to reach out to other Earth science communities. Second, the community needs to develop a new generation of soil models based on a systemic approach comprising relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes to address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of soil processes and their interactions. Overcoming these challenges will facilitate exchanges between soil modeling and climate, plant, and social science modeling communities. It will allow us to contribute to preserve and improve our assessment of ecosystem services and advance our understanding of climate-change feedback mechanisms, among others, thereby facilitating and strengthening communication among scientific disciplines and society. We review the role of modeling soil processes in quantifying key soil processes that shape ecosystem services, with a focus on provisioning and regulating services. We then identify key challenges in modeling soil processes, including the systematic incorporation of heterogeneity and uncertainty, the integration of data and models, and strategies for effective integration of knowledge on physical, chemical, and biological soil processes. We discuss how the soil modeling community could best interface with modern modeling activities in other disciplines, such as climate, ecology, and plant research, and how to weave novel observation and measurement techniques into soil models. We propose the establishment of an international soil modeling consortium to coherently advance soil modeling activities and foster communication with other Earth science disciplines. Such a consortium should promote soil modeling platforms and data repository for model development, calibration and intercomparison essential for addressing contemporary challenges. © Soil Science Society of America 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA.

	abstract = {Variability on the physical characteristics of feedstock has a relevant effect on the reactor's reliability and operating cost. Most of the models developed to optimize biomass supply chains have failed to quantify the effect of biomass quality and preprocessing operations required to meet biomass specifications on overall cost and performance. The Integrated Biomass Supply Analysis and Logistics (IBSAL) model estimates the harvesting, collection, transportation, and storage cost while considering the stochastic behavior of the field-to-biorefinery supply chain. This paper proposes an IBSAL-SimMOpt (Simulation-based Multi-Objective Optimization) method for optimizing the biomass quality and costs associated with the efforts needed to meet conversion technology specifications. The method is developed in two phases. For the first phase, a SimMOpt tool that interacts with the extended IBSAL is developed. For the second phase, the baseline IBSAL model is extended so that the cost for meeting and/or penalization for failing in meeting specifications are considered. The IBSAL-SimMOpt method is designed to optimize quality characteristics of biomass, cost related to activities intended to improve the quality of feedstock, and the penalization cost. A case study based on 1916 farms in Ontario, Canada is considered for testing the proposed method. Analysis of the results demonstrates that this method is able to find a high-quality set of non-dominated solutions. © 2017 by the authors.},

Design/methodology/approach: In line with this objective, the constructs “Green Supply Chain Practices” and “Green Supply Chain Performance” were the two terms that were identified for a co-relational study. Findings: As indicated by the literature review, there is a need to do a more detailed study that can pinpoint particular components of green supply chain practices that have a strong association with particular components of green supply chain performance. This paper attempts to achieve the aim by using a different connotation of these two constructs. Originality/value: Such a study with the connotation and components of green supply chain (GSC) practices and GSC performance as identified and used in this paper might not have been conducted before in the way it is proposed to be used in this paper, thus making this an appropriate contribution.

	abstract = {Six models with differing representation of the physical process in the coupled soil-plant system are tested to simultaneously reproduce the dynamics of soil water contents, evapotranspiration, and leaf area index during a growing season of winter wheat at two contrasting field plots in the Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb regions in South-West Germany. The main aim of the study is the assessment of the performance and the identification of structural deficits of the models LEACHN, SUCROS, CERES, GECROS, and SPASS as well as the land-surface model CLM3.5. The calibration of each model is posed in a multiobjective framework with three different objective functions that summarize the fit between model simulations and the three observation types. The AMALGAM evolutionary search algorithm is utilized to simultaneously estimate the most important soil hydraulic and plant parameters. The six models exhibit a wide variability in the trade-offs between the fitting to the data types. Mechanistic process description, particularly of the root system, reduces the trade-off considerably for the SPASS and GECROS models. These models adequately simulate the reduction of root water uptake and transpiration during senescence under nonlimited soil water supply. The SPASS model in particular shows an overall better performance as compared to the more simpler models which is related to an adequate level of structural complexity in the interplay of all model compartments combined with a relatively low parameter sensitivity to the weighting scheme in the multiobjective optimization. The dynamic consideration of the root system formation is particularly important, which is simulated quite detailed in the SPASS model as a function of nitrogen (N) and water availability in the different soil horizons. The proposed multiobjective calibration procedure proved to be very useful to identify processes that are important to adequately simulate the coupled soil-plant system. The consideration of these processes and our insights about the value of different data types for model calibration is expected to lead to more accurate, predictive land-surface models. © 2013.

	abstract = {A literature review examining the primary methods and parameters applied to evaluate the sustainability of biomass and biofuel supply chains was conducted. This chapter focuses on the primary potential positive and negative impacts of bioenergy and biofuel production on environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainability. Following a description of criteria and indicators suitable to compute biomass chain efficiency, particular attention is paid to integration techniques and mix-method approaches. The final remarks note the potential future trends of research in this sector, with particular emphasis being placed on the paradigm of complexity science and the evaluation of uncertainty in biomass chain assessment and management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Incorporating a number of the author's recent ideas and examples, Dynamic Programming: Foundations and Principles, Second Edition presents a comprehensive and rigorous treatment of dynamic programming. The author emphasizes the crucial role that modeling plays in understanding this area. He also shows how Dijkstra's algorithm is an excellent example of a dynamic programming algorithm, despite the impression given by the computer science literature. New to the Second Edition •Expanded discussions of sequential decision models and the role of the state variable in modeling •A new chapter on forward dynamic programming models •A new chapter on the Push method that gives a dynamic programming perspective on Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem •A new appendix on the Corridor method Taking into account recent developments in dynamic programming, this edition continues to provide a systematic, formal outline of Bellman's approach to dynamic programming. It looks at dynamic programming as a problem-solving methodology, identifying its constituent components and explaining its theoretical basis for tackling problems. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
