	abstract = {Biochar, a material whose properties are critically defined by its elemental composition, has been promoted as a sustainable way to treat various biomass wastes, including agricultural residues. However, considerable variability in these compositions across studies necessitates precise predictive techniques. This research followed the PRISMA rules for data collection and study selection, compiling data on feedstock properties and pyrolysis parameters from 38 published studies. A novel Feature-oriented Imputation method was established and employed, utilizing K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) or Random Forest (RF) imputer to fill in missing values for features with differing characteristics. The reprocessed data were then fed into six distinct datasets and analyzed using a Gradient Boosting Regression model to predict the contents of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in biochar. The rigorous machine learning process yielded excellent accuracy rates: C (R2 = 0.9088, RMSE = 4.0614), H (R2 = 0.9068, RMSE = 0.4180), O (R2 = 0.9172, RMSE = 2.6475), N (R2 = 0.8950, RMSE = 0.3416), P (R2 = 0.9699, RMSE = 0.0244), and K (R2 = 0.9464, RMSE = 0.3842). A comprehensive analysis of feature importance revealed that feedstock properties generally hold more significance in determining the elemental composition of biochar compared to pyrolysis parameters. The highest heating temperature (HHT) emerged as the most influential parameter for the content of H and O, while the contents of N, P, and K were predominantly determined by their respective levels in the feedstock. From these insights, optimal pyrolysis parameters were derived to tailor biochar with different elemental compositions for various applications. The developed models offer a robust framework for predicting the elemental compositions of biochar derived from various agricultural biomass, thereby eliminating the need for complex and resource-intensive laboratory trials. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {The rising consumption of fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gases have made sustainable energy generation an absolute necessity. With its ability to be produced from a variety of biomass sources, including non-edible ones like macro-algae, animal fat and used cooking oil, biofuels have the potential to provide a sustainable energy alternative to non-renewable sources. Macro-algae serves as a cost-effective and accessible solution for energy generation. Accelerated biodiesel supply chain development is essential to support large-scale sustainable production. This research focuses on designing an optimized and sustainable supply chain for third-generation biodiesel production from macro-algae. The main contribution lies in developing a multi-objective optimization model that minimizes supply chain costs and environmental impacts while addressing critical factors such as transportation logistics, facility placement and the impact of advertising on biodiesel demand. The proposed strategy effectively reduces supply chain costs and environmental impacts. Advertising promotes biodiesel as an alternative to fossil fuels, thereby influencing its demand. The proposed multi-objective optimization model is implemented using the Genetic Algorithm. Three macro-algae species (Ulva fasciata, Cystoseira indica and Gracilaria corticata) are strategically integrated into an extensive network of bio-refineries, biodiesel depots, multi-extraction centres and diverse supply sources. The findings highlight substantial costs associated with biofuel supply chain installation, with production facilities accounting for 61.6% of the biodiesel setup costs. Biofuel supply chain installation contributes 69.8% of the total environmental impact. A numerical example and sensitivity analysis of essential factors are conducted to assess the model’s practicality and validity. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Rapid and cost-effective development of a hydrogen distribution infrastructure is an indispensable element of the transition from the current fossil-based to a completely renewables-based energy supply system. In addition to sustainable hydrogen production, e.g. by water electrolysis, biogas reforming or biomass gasification, a comprehensive system for the transport, storage, and distribution of green hydrogen must be established and adapted to specific net-zero pathways. The mathematical modeling and optimization of hydrogen transport in pipeline networks have often been overlooked or simplified in the existing literature. Such simplifications can lead to inaccuracies in energetic and/or economic evaluations, and even jeopardize the feasibility of a model-based network design. In the present work, we develop a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approach for the topology optimization of a hydrogen pipeline network. It minimizes the total installed cost (TIC) while ensuring gas pipeline hydraulics, logical, and safety constraints. The Irish gas network (re-)design is considered as a case study for this extensible MINLP model. For covering both short- and long-term objectives in topology optimization, three different hydrogen demand scenarios are investigated. In addition, different network design scenarios are considered to assess the feasibility and benefits of different topologies. The results of this case study show that repurposing the entire existing Irish natural gas network is not the most cost-effective solution. Importantly, the evaluation of multiple demand scenarios reveals the limits of hydrogen demand that can be accommodated by the current pipeline infrastructure. This raises questions regarding the design of a hydrogen network facing an increasing demand over time. © 2025 The Authors},

Conventional separation membranes exhibit fundamental limitations in addressing these intertwined challenges. We pioneer a groundbreaking biomass-derived sonocatalytic/phptocatalytic platform by strategically engineering natural wood. Through hydrothermal synthesis and precise TiO2 modification of Bi2Sn2O7 nanoparticles, we constructed TiO2-Bi2Sn2O7, which were seamlessly integrated into the wood matrix via spray deposition technology. Capitalizing on wood's unique anisotropic porosity and eco-friendly characteristics, our bio-inspired design achieves unprecedented performance that robust hydrophobicity, exceptional oil–water separation efficiency (97% retention after 15 rigorous cycles), and remarkable environmental resilience maintaining functionality under extreme conditions. Most strikingly, we developed a stimuli-responsive system where acrylic acid functionalization enables dynamic, reversible toggling between hydrophobic/lipophilic and hydrophilic/oleophobic states − a critical advancement for adaptive wastewater treatment. The engineered smart wood possessed superior underwater oleophobic (146.3 ± 2.74° removal angle), and synergistic sonocatalytic degradation (95 % AO7 dye elimination in 60 min under ultrasonication). This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable water purification technologies, showcasing wood's transformative potential as a multifunctional platform.

	abstract = {The growing demand for eco-friendly and sustainable heat and power generation has sparked interest in small-scale biomass and biowaste conversion technologies. Gasification, a key method, offers low-emission fuel production by converting materials into liquid or gaseous fuels. Owing to limited measurement capabilities and time- and money-consuming experimentation, numerical modeling is an invaluable tool in recognizing the phenomena comprising the process and predicting the gasifier performance. The goal of the work is to analyze the dynamics of biomass conversion in a batch downdraft gasifier while taking into account the movement of particles shrinking due to thermal decomposition. The focus is on the process dynamics in the upper reactor, where the associated change in the particle size and bed structure are significant. Two simulation methods, based on the coupled Euler–Lagrange approach, are utilized. First, we developed a novel Dynamic Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian (DCEL) method implemented in Fortran and Python. It solves the mass balance for bed sublayer-representative solid particles and the energy balance for the packed bed. Using 2D modeling, this approach effectively captures thermal effects from conduction, radiation, and fuel decomposition. The second one involves 3D modeling and employs the extended discrete element method (XDEM) that, coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), can predict the movement of the solid fuel particles undergoing thermal conversion in an external fluid field. The distribution of temperature and pyrolysis gas yield and the movement of the fuel particles, predicted via utilizing both methods are compared and discussed. Though some discrepancies were observed between the models’ predictions as regards heat transfer and fuel mass loss rates, both approaches demonstrate the importance of accounting for particle shrinkage and their corresponding movement in the simulation of fuel conversion in a fixed bed. © 2025 The Authors},

Herein, inspired by algae's photosynthetic product transport pathway in-between stem and leaf, we present a scalable and cost-effective strategy to fabricate a multifunctional photothermal evaporator (MPE) utilizing carbonized medical waste residues. After optimized water-heat distribution at the solar evaporation interface, the MPE achieves 93.9 % solar-to-vapor efficiency with an evaporation rate of 1.56 kg m−2h−1 under 1 sun irradiation, maintaining robust performance (1.54 kg m−2h−1) in extreme environments, including hypersaline brines and wastewater with extreme pH conditions (pH 1–14). The MPE exhibits exceptional seawater purification performance, achieving three-order-of-magnitude reduction in ionic contaminants (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+ and B3+; < 1.3 mg/L) while simultaneously removing > 99 % organic pollutants via hydroxyl-mediated chelation and hydrogen-bonding complexation mechanisms. Besides, the experiments showed that the collected water is relatively clean with complete removal of pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) by damaging bacterial cell walls. Moreover, the MPE exhibits exceptional cycling stability with minimal efficiency loss, demonstrating practical durability. The interfacial solar-driven steam generation (ISSG) system based on MPE addresses critical challenges in sustainable freshwater production by integrating high evaporation efficiency, robust pollutant removal, antibacterial functionality and resistance to extreme conditions, specifically designed to benefit economically stressed communities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Climate change and global warming are primarily driven by carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuel combustion across energy, transportation, and industrial sectors. Among industrial contributors, the production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is a significant source of emissions due to its energy-intensive processes and chemical decomposition of limestone. Cement is widely used in concrete because of its cost-effectiveness and reliability; however, its high energy consumption and environmental impact necessitate the search for sustainable alternatives. Previous studies have explored various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash, silica fume, and groundnut shell ash (GSA), but many lack optimization in their application, particularly in tailoring the GSA content with water[sbnd]cement (w/c) ratios to achieve optimal workability and mechanical performance. Additionally, existing research often overlooks systematic experimental designs that comprehensively evaluate fresh and hardened properties via advanced statistical techniques. This study addresses these gaps by employing response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize concrete mixtures incorporating GSA as a partial cement replacement (3–12 %) with w/c ratios ranging from 0.4–0.6. Workability (slump, Vee–Bee consistency, compaction factor) and mechanical properties (compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength) were evaluated according to Indian standards. The results demonstrated that the GSA significantly influenced the concrete properties, with an optimal mixture of 6.27 % GSA and a 0.42 w/c ratio achieving a desirability of 66.38 %. This study provides a data-driven approach to enhancing concrete sustainability by utilizing agricultural waste while addressing key shortcomings in prior research. The optimized concrete mixture not only demonstrated enhanced mechanical and fresh properties but also significantly contributes to the broader agenda of sustainable construction. By incorporating groundnut shell ash (GSA), an agricultural waste, this study promotes circular economy practices and reduces reliance on traditional cement, which is a major contributor to global CO₂ emissions. The findings underscore the feasibility of replacing a portion of OPC with GSA without compromising performance, thereby supporting the transition to greener infrastructure materials. This research lays the groundwork for scalable, eco-efficient concrete production, especially in regions with abundant agricultural residues. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {A major share of the global energy demand is currently met by fossil fuels. However, environmental concerns and dwindling reserves have necessitated a progressive shift toward renewable energy. Ranked fourth globally in wind power installed capacity, India plans to implement a new wind farm design in Anjugramam, Tamil Nadu. The present study provides a novel, systematic pre-installation feasibility assessment for this specific, sanctioned onshore wind farm, focusing on the deployment of large, utility-scale onshore turbines (Siemens SWT-4.0–120), an area that is not adequately explored in the Indian context compared to studies on smaller, localized applications. The assessment considers turbine placement, space, and environmental impacts, and a modern simulation package like WindPro software is employed. Key parameters, including wind strength, energy output, noise distribution, shadow flicker, visual impact, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, are evaluated. For the proposed Anjugramam wind farm comprising two 4 MW Siemens onshore wind turbines, the study projects an annual energy production (AEP) of 43,388.1 MWh. This level of clean energy generation is estimated to achieve an annual GHG emission reduction of 22,822.14 tonnes of CO2 equivalent compared to conventional energy sources. Noise modeling indicated levels between 55–58 dB within the wind farm array, and zone of visual influence (ZVI) analysis showed that at least one turbine would be visible from 91.8% of the surrounding viewpoints. Further economic analysis projects a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the wind farm at approximately ¢2.42–2.64/kWh (excluding monetized carbon benefits), which is found competitive against existing benchmark biomass LCOE studies. This study contributes a technology-driven framework designed for broader applicability in assessing the viability of similar wind energy projects, aimed at optimizing larger turbine deployment for maximized regional energy output while minimizing negative impacts, thereby offering a transferable approach beyond singular site-specific studies. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {A diverse array of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors influences the quantity and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW). Yet, the paucity of consistent waste data continues to impede the formulation of effective solid waste management strategies globally. This gap poses significant barriers to achieving various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to responsible consumption and production, environmental sustainability, and promotion of circular economy. In light of these challenges, this study primarily accentuates the transformative potential of Machine Learning (ML) for sustainable waste management. ML models offer promising solutions for projecting waste composition and generation trends while optimizing resource distribution by analyzing key influential factors. Nevertheless, existing ML applications often lack standardization and generalizability across regions. Therefore, this paper objectively advocates for the necessity of robust global ML models to standardize metrics, facilitating reliable comparisons of region- or nation-wise solid waste generation and composition patterns. Additionally, this study aims to emphasize the broader utility of such models in, but not limited to, addressing leachate quantity, landfill composition, and groundwater contamination issues, ultimately promoting scalable, data-driven approaches for informed and sustainable waste management worldwide. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is an important aspect of building sustainable communities, but is still a significant challenge in most countries as MSW generation is increasing globally. Efficient and proper waste management is a complicated issue that is impacted by global economic factors, environmental policies, finances, and social awareness. In Kuwait, the main challenge is associated with the uncontrolled increase of MSW generation. As a result, the predominant management method in Kuwait is waste disposal, which means the majority of the waste is disposed of in dumpsites without prior processing. Additionally, the lack of selective collection and segregation at the source hampers effective waste management efforts, which leads to increased waste disposal. This study contributes to the growing body of work on MSW management in Kuwait and addresses the gap in the literature by examining the current MSW composition and tackling the fundamental challenges in the waste sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the characteristics and chemical composition of MSW in Kuwait and provide policy recommendations for sustainable waste management practices. The findings of this study revealed that the average amount of municipal waste generated is 1.7 kg per person per day. Organic waste, paper, and plastics represented the largest fractions of MSW at 37.1%, 25.6%, and 26%, respectively. Food waste (a sub-component of organics) accounted for the highest fraction of MSW (35.1%), followed by plastic bags (at approximately 16.1%). The heavy metals analysis revealed that, on average, copper concentrations on the selected MSW components were below World Health Organization (WHO) maximum soil permissible limits. While zinc concentrations were above the maximum soil permissible limit set by the WHO for cardboard and mixed paper. Energy recovery presents a viable management option, as a large fraction of recyclables are either contaminated (paper) or have little to no market value (plastic film). Reforming the waste sector requires an overarching national vision toward waste reduction, the further incentivization of the waste hierarchy framework, as well as a set of robust policies and regulatory actions to make the disposal of untreated waste more expensive (landfill taxes) than other management options. © The Author(s) 2025.},
